A key part of this is phasing out the reliance on traditional \"dryrun\" simulations for reading process state. Instead, processes are encouraged to use the ~patch@1.0 device to expose specific parts of their state directly via GET requests. This allows for more efficient and direct state access, particularly for web interfaces and external integrations. You can learn more about this mechanism in the Exposing Process State with the Patch Device guide. What is the difference between HyperBEAM and Compute Unit?¶ HyperBEAM: The Erlang-based node software that handles message routing, process management, and device coordination. Compute Unit (CU): A NodeJS implementation that executes WebAssembly modules and handles computational tasks. Together, these components form a complete execution environment for AO processes.

They are self-contained modules that process messages and perform specific actions, forming the building blocks of your application's logic. HyperBEAM comes with a set of powerful built-in devices that handle everything from process management (~process@1.0) and message scheduling (~scheduler@1.0) to executing WebAssembly (~wasm64@1.0) and Lua scripts (~lua@5.3a). Creating Your Own Devices (Coming Soon)¶ We will create more in depth guides for building devices in Lua and Erlang in the future.

The ecosystem consists of ~auth-hook@1.0 (authentication interceptor), ~secret@1.0 (wallet storage), ~cookie@1.0 (session management), and ~http-auth@1.0 (HTTP Basic authentication). Core Concept: Zero-Friction Authentication¶ Users interact with decentralized applications like traditional web apps while HyperBEAM handles cryptographic operations server-side. The wallet- patterns ~http-auth@1.0¶ Provides HTTP Basic authentication with PBKDF2 key derivation (1,200,000 iterations, SHA256). generate: Processes Authorization headers and derives signing keys Flow: Returns 401 with WWW-Authenticate when credentials missing, otherwise derives key and signs Performance PBKDF2 performs ~5-10 derivations/second for brute-force protection. Device Integration¶ The authentication workflow: HTTP request with &! → auth-hook intercepts → provider generates secret → secret device signs → authenticated response returned. Integration with Core Devices: ~process@1.0: Automatic signing of process communications ~query@1.0: Authenticated data discovery ~copycat@1.0: Authenticated data replication ~meta@1.0: Authentication provider configuration Multi-Provider Configuration: \"on\": { \"request\": [ {\"device\": \"auth-hook@1.0\", \"secret-provider\": {\"device\": \"cookie@1.0\"}}, {\"device\": \"auth-hook@1.0\", \"secret-provider\": {\"device\": \"http-auth@1.0\"}} ] } Security Considerations¶ Security Layers: Provider authentication (Cookie/HTTP) → Access control messages → Controller verification → Request signing (RSA-PSS/HMAC) Best Practices: HTTPS-only, secure cookie attributes, strong PBKDF2 parameters, session key rotation, audit logging Trust Model Intended for deployment in Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) with ~snp@1.0 or trusted nodes. Private keys never leave server memory. All operations create cryptographically auditable signatures. Configuration Examples¶ Cookie Authentication: \"on\": {\"request\": {\"device\": \"auth-hook@1.0\", \"secret-provider\": {\"device\": \"cookie@1.0\"}}} HTTP Basic Authentication: \"secret-provider\": {\"device\": \"http-auth@1.0\", \"realm\": \"Protected\", \"iterations\": 2000000} Multi-Signature: \"secret-provider\": { \"device\": \"cookie@1.0\", \"controllers\": [\"admin1\", \"admin2\"], \"required-controllers\": 2 } Practical Implications¶ For Application Developers: This ecosystem eliminates blockchain onboarding friction. Users access your dApp without installing wallets or managing keys—authentication happens transparently via cookies or HTTP Basic Auth. Your application simply adds &! to requests that need signing. For Node Operators: You control the trust model. Deploy in TEE for trustless environments or trusted nodes for enterprise scenarios. Cookie-based auth suits consumer applications, while HTTP Basic Auth serves API integrations and enterprise SSO systems. Multi-signature configurations enable shared custody models. For End Users: Single-click access to blockchain applications with traditional web experience. No seed phrases to manage, no browser extensions to install. Sessions persist across devices when using non-volatile storage mode. Authentication state syncs via cookies or HTTP headers.

This device is essential for: Core Functions (Keys)¶ info¶ Retrieves or modifies the node's configuration message (often referred to as NodeMsg internally). GET /~meta@1.0/info Action: Returns the current node configuration message. Response: A message map containing the node's settings. Sensitive keys (like private wallets) are filtered out. Dynamically generated keys like the node's public address are added if a wallet is configured. POST /~meta@1.0/info Action: Updates the node's configuration message. Requires the request to be signed by the node's configured operator key/address. Request Body: A message map containing the configuration keys and values to update. Response: Confirmation message indicating success or failure. Note: Once a node's configuration is marked as initialized = permanent, it cannot be changed via this method. Key Configuration Parameters Managed by ~meta¶ While the info key is the primary interaction point, the NodeMsg managed by ~meta holds crucial configuration parameters affecting the entire node's behavior, including (but not limited to): port: HTTP server port. priv_wallet / key_location: Path to the node's Arweave key file. operator: The address designated as the node operator (defaults to the address derived from priv_wallet). initialized: Status indicating if the node setup is temporary or permanent. preprocessor / postprocessor: Optional messages defining pre/post-processing logic for requests. routes: Routing table used by dev_router. store: Configuration for data storage. trace: Debug tracing options. p4_*: Payment configuration. faff_*: Access control lists. (Refer to hb_opts.erl for a comprehensive list of options.) Utility Functions (Internal/Module Level)¶ The dev_meta.erl module also contains helper functions used internally or callable from other Erlang modules: is_operator(, ) -> boolean(): Checks if the signer of RequestMsg matches the configured operator in NodeMsg. Pre/Post-Processing Hooks¶ The ~meta device applies the node's configured preprocessor message before resolving the main request and the postprocessor message after obtaining the result, allowing for global interception and modification of requests/responses. Initialization¶ Before a node can process general requests, it usually needs to be initialized.

They define the specific logic for how computations are performed, data is handled, or interactions occur within the AO ecosystem. Think of Devices as specialized engines or services that can be plugged into the AO framework. This modularity is key to AO's flexibility and extensibility. Purpose of Devices¶ Define Computation: Devices dictate how a message's instructions are executed. One device might run WASM code, another might manage process state, and yet another might simply relay data. Enable Specialization: Nodes running HyperBEAM can choose which Devices to support, allowing them to specialize in certain tasks (e.g., high-compute tasks, storage-focused tasks, secure TEE operations). Promote Modularity: New functionalities can be added to AO by creating new Devices, without altering the core protocol. Distribute Workload: Different Devices can handle different parts of a complex task, enabling parallel processing and efficient resource utilization across the network. Device Naming and Versioning¶ Devices are typically referenced using a name and version, like ~@ (e.g., ~process@1.0). The tilde (~) often indicates a primary, user-facing device, while internal or utility devices might use a dev_ prefix in the source code (e.g., dev_router). Versioning indicates the specific interface and behavior of the device. Changes to a device that break backward compatibility usually result in a version increment. Familiar Examples¶ HyperBEAM includes many preloaded devices that provide core functionality. Some key examples include: ~meta@1.0: Configures the node itself (hardware specs, supported devices, payment info). ~process@1.0: Manages persistent, shared computational states (like traditional smart contracts, but more flexible). ~scheduler@1.0: Handles the ordering and execution of messages within a process. ~wasm64@1.0: Executes WebAssembly (WASM) code, allowing for complex computations written in languages like Rust, C++, etc. ~lua@5.3a: Executes Lua scripts. ~relay@1.0: Forwards messages between AO nodes or to external HTTP endpoints. ~json@1.0: Provides access to JSON data structures. ~message@1.0: Manages message state and processing. Authentication Ecosystem: Comprehensive wallet-less authentication (~auth-hook@1.0, ~secret@1.0, ~cookie@1.0, ~http-auth@1.0). Data Discovery Engine: Advanced message search and query capabilities (~query@1.0). Data Replication Engine: External data ingestion and synchronization (~copycat@1.0). ~patch@1.0: Applies state updates directly to a process, often used for migrating or managing process data. Beyond the Basics¶ Devices aren't limited to just computation or state management. They can represent more abstract concepts: Security & Authentication Devices (~snp@1.0, dev_codec_httpsig, Authentication Ecosystem): Handle tasks related to Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), message signing, wallet-less authentication, and session management, adding layers of security and verification. Data Management Devices (Data Discovery Engine, Data Replication Engine): Provide comprehensive data ingestion, search, and discovery capabilities for building data-rich applications with external source integration. Payment/Access Control Devices (~p4@1.0, ~faff@1.0): Manage metering, billing, or access control for node services. Workflow/Utility Devices (dev_cron, dev_stack, dev_monitor): Coordinate complex execution flows, schedule tasks, or monitor process activity. Using Devices¶ Devices are typically invoked via GET requests. The path specifies which Device should interpret the subsequent parts of the path or the request body. # Example: Execute the 'now' key on the process device for a specific process /~process@1.0/now # Example: Relay a GET request via the relay device /~relay@1.0/call?method=GET&path=https:","estimatedWords":517,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:08:05.172Z","breadcrumbs":["build","devices","hyperbeam devices"],"siteKey":"hyperbeam","siteName":"Hyperbeam","depth":3,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:08:05.172Z"},{"url":"https://hyperbeam.arweave.net/build/getting-started/pathing-in-hyperbeam.html","title":"Pathing in HyperBEAM","content":"Pathing in HyperBEAM¶ Overview¶ Understanding how to construct and interpret paths in AO-Core is fundamental to working with HyperBEAM.

It's not a single-purpose application, but rather a powerful, extensible engine—a \"Swiss Army knife\"—for developers building in the decentralized ecosystem. Designed to be modular, composable, and extensible, HyperBEAM lets you build anything from simple data transformations to complex, high-performance decentralized applications. Thinking in HyperBEAM¶ While AO-Core establishes the foundational concepts of Messages, Devices, and Paths, building on HyperBEAM can be simplified to four key principles: Everything is a message. You can compute on any message by calling its keys by name. The device specified in the message determines how these keys are resolved. The default device, message@1.0, resolves keys to their literal values within the message. Paths are pipelines of messages. A path defines a sequence of 'request' messages to be executed. You can set a key in a message directly within the path using the &key=value syntax. Headers and parameters added after a ? are applied to all messages in the pipeline. Device-specific requests with ~x@y. The ~x@y syntax allows you to apply a request as if the base message had a different device. This provides a powerful way to execute messages using specific compute or storage logic defined by a device. Signed responses over HTTP. The final message in a pipeline is returned as an HTTP response. This response is signed against the hashpath that generated it, ensuring the integrity and verifiability of the computation. Ready to build an AO process? The serverless compute capability is a powerful application of HyperBEAM's modular design. To learn how to create and manage AO processes with WASM or Lua, please refer to the AO Processes Cookbook. Modularity: A System of Devices¶ At its core, HyperBEAM is a modular system built on Devices. Each device is a specialized module responsible for a specific task. This modular architecture means you can think of HyperBEAM's functionality as a set of building blocks. Use Case: Imagine you need to create a serverless API that takes a number, runs a calculation, and returns a result. You would use the ~wasm64@1.0 or ~lua@5.3a devices to execute your calculation logic without needing to manage a server. If your API needs to return JSON, you can pipe the output to the ~json@1.0 device to ensure it's formatted correctly. Composability: Chaining Logic with URL Paths¶ HyperBEAM's modular devices become even more powerful when combined. Its pathing routing mechanism leverages standard URLs to create powerful, composable pipelines. By constructing a URL, you can define a \"path\" of messages that are executed in sequence, with the output of one message becoming the input for the next. Use Case: Suppose you have a token process and want to calculate the total circulating supply without making the client download and compute all balances. You can construct a single URL that: Reads the latest state of the AO process. Pipes the state to a Lua script and calls the sum function, which sums the balances from the state. Formats the final result as a JSON object. The request would look something like this: /{process-id}~process@1.0/now/~lua@5.3a&module={module-id}/sum/serialize~json@1.0 This path chains together the operations, returning just the computed supply in a single, efficient request. Find the full example in the AO Process Cookbook Learn more about Pathing in HyperBEAM. Extensibility: Building Beyond the Core¶ HyperBEAM is not a closed system. It is designed to be extended, allowing developers to add new functionality tailored to their specific needs. Build Custom Devices¶ You can build and deploy your own devices in Erlang to introduce entirely new, high-level functionality to the network. Use Case: You could build a custom device that acts as a bridge to another blockchain's API, allowing your AO processes to interact with external systems seamlessly. Learn how to Build Your Own Device. Achieve Raw Performance with Native Code¶ For the most demanding, performance-critical tasks, you can write Native Implemented Functions (NIFs) in low-level languages like C or Rust. These NIFs integrate directly with the Erlang VM, offering the highest possible performance. Use Case: If you were building a sophisticated cryptographic application, you could implement a new, high-speed hashing algorithm as a NIF to ensure maximum performance and security. This \"raw\" extensibility provides an escape hatch for ultimate control.

AO-Core is a protocol and standard for distributed computation that forms the foundation of the AO Computer. Inspired by and built upon concepts from the Erlang language, AO-Core embraces the actor model for concurrent, distributed systems. It defines a minimal, generalized model for decentralized computation built around standard web technologies like HTTP. Think of it as a way to interpret the Arweave permaweb not just as static storage, but as a dynamic, programmable, and infinitely scalable computing environment. Unlike traditional blockchain systems, AO-Core defines a flexible, powerful computation protocol that enables a wide range of applications beyond just running Lua programs. Core Concepts¶ AO-Core revolves around three fundamental components: Messages Modular Data Packets Messages are cryptographically linked, forming a verifiable computation graph. Devices Extensible Execution Engines AO-Core introduces a modular architecture centered around Devices. These are pluggable components—typically implemented as modules—that define specific computational logic, such as executing WASM, managing state, or relaying data. Devices interpret and process messages, allowing for flexible and extensible computation. This design enables developers to extend the system by creating custom Devices to fit their specific needs, making the network highly adaptable and composable. Paths Composable Pipelines Paths in AO-Core are structures that link messages over time, creating a verifiable history of computations. They allow users to navigate the computation graph and access specific states or results. AO-Core leverages HashPaths—cryptographic fingerprints representing the sequence of operations leading to a specific message state—ensuring traceability and integrity. This pathing mechanism enables developers to compose complex, verifiable data pipelines and interact with processes and data in a flexible, trustless manner. Key Features¶ AO-Core is inherently resilient, running across a global network of machines that eliminates any single point of failure. Its computations are permanent, immutably stored on Arweave so they can be recalled—or continued—at any time. The protocol remains permissionless, meaning anyone can participate. And it is trustless, with every state mathematically verifiable so no central authority is required. The Actor Model in AO¶ Inspired by Erlang, AO-Core implements the actor model to provide a foundation for inherently concurrent, distributed, and scalable systems. In this model, computation is performed by independent actors (or processes). These actors communicate exclusively by passing messages to one another, and each can make local decisions, send more messages, and create new actors. Beyond Processes¶ While AO Processes (smart contracts built using the AO-Core protocol) are a powerful application, AO-Core itself enables a much broader range of computational patterns: Serverless functions with trustless guarantees Hybrid applications combining smart contracts and serverless functionality Custom execution environments through new devices Composable systems using the path language October 3, 2025","estimatedWords":444,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:08:07.425Z","breadcrumbs":["build","introduction","what is ao core"],"siteKey":"hyperbeam","siteName":"Hyperbeam","depth":3,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:08:07.425Z"},{"url":"https://hyperbeam.arweave.net/run/running-a-hyperbeam-node.html","title":"Running a HyperBEAM Node","content":"Running a HyperBEAM Node¶ This guide provides the basics for running your own HyperBEAM node, installing dependencies, and connecting to the AO network.

It serves as a decentralized operating system, powering the AO Computer—a scalable, trust-minimized, distributed supercomputer built on permanent storage of Arweave. Implementing AO-Core¶ HyperBEAM transforms the abstract concepts of AO-Core—Messages, Devices, and Paths—into a concrete, operational system. It provides the runtime environment and essential services to execute these computations across a network of distributed nodes. Messages Modular Data Packets In HyperBEAM, every interaction within the AO Computer is handled as a message. A message is a binary item or a map of functions. These cryptographically-linked data units are the foundation for communication, allowing processes to trigger computations, query state, and transfer value. HyperBEAM nodes are responsible for routing and processing these messages according to the rules of the AO-Core protocol. Devices Extensible Execution Engines HyperBEAM introduces a uniquely modular architecture centered around Devices. These pluggable components are Erlang modules that define specific computational logic—like running WASM, managing state, or relaying data—allowing for unprecedented flexibility. This design allows developers to extend the system by creating custom Devices to fit their specific computational needs. Paths Composable Pipelines HyperBEAM exposes a powerful HTTP API that uses structured URL patterns to interact with processes and data. This pathing mechanism allows developers to create verifiable data pipelines, composing functionality from multiple devices into a single, atomic request. The URL bar effectively becomes a command-line interface for AO's trustless compute environment. A Robust and Scalable Foundation¶ Built on the Erlang/OTP framework, HyperBEAM provides a robust and secure foundation that leverages the BEAM virtual machine for exceptional concurrency, fault tolerance, and scalability. This abstracts away underlying hardware, allowing diverse nodes to contribute resources without compatibility issues. The system governs how nodes coordinate and interact, forming a decentralized network that is resilient and permissionless.

What is HyperBEAM?¶ HyperBEAM is a client implementation of the AO-Core protocol written in Erlang. It serves as the node software for a decentralized operating system that allows operators to offer computational resources to users in the AO network. What are the system requirements for running HyperBEAM?¶ Currently, HyperBEAM is primarily tested and documented for Ubuntu 22.04 and macOS. Other platforms will be added in future updates. For detailed requirements, see the System Requirements page. Can I run HyperBEAM in a container?¶ While technically possible, running HyperBEAM in Docker containers or other containerization technologies is currently not recommended. The containerization approach may introduce additional complexity and potential performance issues. We recommend running HyperBEAM directly on the host system until container support is more thoroughly tested and optimized. How do I update HyperBEAM to the latest version?¶ To update HyperBEAM: Pull the latest code from the repository (check Discord for the branch of Beta releases) Rebuild the application Restart the HyperBEAM service Specific update instructions will vary depending on your installation method. Can I run multiple HyperBEAM nodes on a single machine?¶ Yes, you can run multiple HyperBEAM nodes on a single machine, but you'll need to configure them to use different ports and data directories to avoid conflicts. However, this is not recommended for production environments as each node should ideally have a unique IP address to properly participate in the network. Running multiple nodes on a single machine is primarily useful for development and testing purposes. Is there a limit to how many processes can run on a node?¶ The practical limit depends on your hardware resources. Erlang is designed to handle millions of lightweight processes efficiently, but the actual number will be determined by: Available memory CPU capacity Network bandwidth Storage speed The complexity of your processes Where can I get help if I encounter issues?¶ If you encounter issues: Check the Troubleshooting guide Search or ask questions on GitHub Issues Join the community on Discord October 3, 2025","estimatedWords":346,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:08:11.540Z","breadcrumbs":["run","reference","faq"],"siteKey":"hyperbeam","siteName":"Hyperbeam","depth":2,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:08:11.540Z"},{"url":"https://hyperbeam.arweave.net/run/reference/glossary.html","title":"Node Operator Glossary","content":"Node Operator Glossary¶ This glossary provides definitions for terms and concepts relevant to running a HyperBEAM node.

Description¶ It can run in two modes: fold (the default), and map. In fold mode, it runs upon input messages in the order of their keys. A stack maintains and passes forward a state (expressed as a message) as it progresses through devices. For example, a stack of devices as follows: Device -> Stack Device-Stack/1/Name -> Add-One-Device Device-Stack/2/Name -> Add-Two-Device When called with the message: #{ Path = \"FuncName\", binary => > } Will produce the output: #{ Path = \"FuncName\", binary => > } {ok, #{ bin => > }} In map mode, the stack will run over all the devices in the stack, and combine their results into a single message. Each of the devices' output values have a key that is the device's name in the Device-Stack (its number if the stack is a list). You can switch between fold and map modes by setting the Mode key in the Msg2 to either Fold or Map, or set it globally for the stack by setting the Mode key in the Msg1 message. The key in Msg2 takes precedence over the key in Msg1. The key that is called upon the device stack is the same key that is used upon the devices that are contained within it. For example, in the above scenario we resolve FuncName on the stack, leading FuncName to be called on Add-One-Device and Add-Two-Device. A device stack responds to special statuses upon responses as follows: skip: Skips the rest of the device stack for the current pass. pass: Causes the stack to increment its pass number and re-execute the stack from the first device, maintaining the state accumulated so far. Only available in fold mode. In all cases, the device stack will return the accumulated state to the caller as the result of the call to the stack. The dev_stack adds additional metadata to the message in order to track the state of its execution as it progresses through devices. These keys are as follows: Stack-Pass: The number of times the stack has reset and re-executed from the first device for the current message. Input-Prefix: The prefix that the device should use for its outputs and inputs. Output-Prefix: The device that was previously executed. All counters used by the stack are initialized to 1. Additionally, as implemented in HyperBEAM, the device stack will honor a number of options that are passed to it as keys in the message. Each of these options is also passed through to the devices contained within the stack during execution. These options include: Error-Strategy: Determines how the stack handles errors from devices. See maybe_error/5 for more information. Allow-Multipass: Determines whether the stack is allowed to automatically re-execute from the first device when the pass tag is returned. See maybe_pass/3 for more information. Under-the-hood, dev_stack uses a default handler to resolve all calls to devices, aside set/2 which it calls itself to mutate the message's device key in order to change which device is currently being executed. This method allows dev_stack to ensure that the message's HashPath is always correct, even as it delegates calls to other devices. An example flow for a dev_stack execution is as follows: /Msg1/AlicesExcitingKey -> dev_stack:execute -> /Msg1/Set?device=/Device-Stack/1 -> /Msg2/AlicesExcitingKey -> /Msg3/Set?device=/Device-Stack/2 -> /Msg4/AlicesExcitingKey ... -> /MsgN/Set?device=[This-Device] -> returns {ok, /MsgN+1} -> /MsgN+1 In this example, the device key is mutated a number of times, but the resulting HashPath remains correct and verifiable.

Current State of ArNS Trading No established marketplace exists yet - While ANTs are technically transferable tokens, there is currently no widely adopted marketplace specifically for ArNS trading. Direct transfers are possible - You can transfer ANTs directly between wallets, but this requires technical knowledge and direct coordination between buyer and seller.

Built on AO, ARIO leverages the computational power and permanence of the Arweave ecosystem to create a robust, decentralized infrastructure token. Key Features Native AO Token: ARIO is built directly on AO Computer, utilizing its decentralized compute capabilities for smart contract execution and network operations Staking-Based Infrastructure: The network operates on a staking-based incentive system where gateway operators secure infrastructure services through token commitment Multi-utility Design: ARIO serves multiple functions within the ecosystem, from network participation to governance and payments Incentive Mechanisms ARIO's design creates powerful incentives for network participants through multiple reward streams: Gateway Operator Incentives Staking Rewards: Gateway operators earn rewards for maintaining network infrastructure and providing reliable data services Performance Bonuses: Additional rewards for gateways that demonstrate high uptime and fast response times Network Growth Rewards: Operators benefit as the network scales and generates more activity Delegator Rewards Delegated Staking: Token holders can delegate their ARIO to trusted gateway operators to participate in network operations Increased Operator Stake: Delegation enhances gateway operator visibility and influence within the network Shared Risk and Rewards: Delegators participate in the risk and rewards of gateway operations Withdrawal Flexibility: Delegated tokens can be withdrawn following the same vault lock period rules Ecosystem Participation ArNS Revenue Sharing: Name registration fees flow back to network participants through the reward distribution mechanism Protocol Growth: As network usage increases, token utility and value proposition strengthen Community Incentives: Active participation in governance and ecosystem development is rewarded Staking Architecture The AR.IO Network implements a robust staking-based incentive system that ensures infrastructure reliability and network participation: Gateway Operator Requirements Gateway operators must stake a minimum amount of ARIO tokens to join the network Staking demonstrates commitment to network objectives and promotes infrastructure reliability Only gateways that pass Observation and Incentive Protocol evaluations receive rewards Staked tokens remain locked until withdrawal is initiated or vault period expires Network Quality Assurance Non-Inflationary Design: Fixed supply of 1 billion ARIO tokens with no minting mechanism Immutable Protocol: No governance control or special write access for upgrades Infrastructure Focus: Staking secures gateway infrastructure for permanent cloud services Peer Monitoring: Gateways serve as observers, testing and evaluating each other's performance Economic Incentives Gateway operators earn rewards only when they pass observation evaluations (≥50% consensus) Staking creates opportunity cost that aligns operator incentives with network health Observer gateways receive additional rewards for monitoring network quality Delegated staking allows broader community participation in successful gateway operations Built on AO Computer ARIO's foundation on AO Computer provides unique advantages: Computational Permanence All token operations and smart contracts benefit from Arweave's permanent storage Network history and token transactions are immutably recorded Computational results are verifiable and permanent Decentralized Execution Token logic runs across distributed AO processes, eliminating single points of failure Smart contract upgrades follow community governance processes Network operations scale with AO's computational capacity Ecosystem Integration Native compatibility with other AO-based applications and tokens Seamless interaction with Arweave's data storage layer Built-in interoperability with the broader permaweb ecosystem Explore the Token Token ArchitectureLearn about ARIO's technical implementation and AO Computer integrationGet the TokenDiscover where and how to acquire ARIO tokensStaking & DelegationUnderstand how to stake ARIO and delegate to gatewaysAdd to WanderLearn how to add ARIO to your Wander walletHow is this guide?GoodBadUse CasesExplore practical applications of the Wayfinder Protocol across different industries and use casesArchitectureExplore the technical architecture of the $ARIO contract and the AR.IO Network system components","estimatedWords":585,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:08:53.948Z","breadcrumbs":["learn","token"],"siteKey":"ario","siteName":"AR-IO Network","depth":2,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:08:53.948Z"},{"url":"https://docs.ar.io/learn/wayfinder","title":"Wayfinder Protocol","content":"Wayfinder ProtocolCopy MarkdownOpenThe Problem: Centralized Gateway Reliance Today, most Arweave content is accessed through a single gateway: arweave.net.

Arweave URLs and transaction IDs are long, difficult to remember, and occasionally categorized as spam. The Arweave Name System (ArNS) aims to resolve these problems in a decentralized manner. ArNS is a censorship-resistant naming system stored on Arweave, powered by ARIO tokens, enabled through AR.IO gateway domains, and used to connect friendly domain names to permaweb apps, web pages, data, and identities. It's an open, permissionless, domain name registrar that doesn't rely on a single TLD. How ArNS Works This system works similarly to traditional DNS services, where users can purchase a name in a registry and DNS Name servers resolve these names to IP addresses. The system is flexible and allows users to purchase names permanently or lease them for a defined duration based on their use case. With ArNS, the registry is stored permanently on Arweave via AO, making it immutable and globally resilient. This also means that apps and infrastructure cannot just read the latest state of the registry but can also check any point in time in the past, creating a \"Wayback Machine\" of permanent data. Name Resolution Users can register a name, like ardrive, within the ArNS Registry. Before owning a name, they must create an Arweave Name Token (ANT), an AO Computer based token and open-source protocol used by ArNS to track the ownership and control over the name. ANTs allow the owner to set a mutable pointer to any type of permaweb data, like a page, app or file, via its Arweave transaction ID. Each AR.IO gateway acts as an ArNS Name resolver. They fetch the latest state of both the ArNS Registry and its associated ANTs from an AO compute unit (CU) and serve this information rapidly for apps and users.

Gateways are incentivized to maintain high performance while also serving as \"observers\" that evaluate their peers' ArNS resolution capabilities and data integrity verification. The protocol operates on 24-hour epochs where up to 50 gateways are selected as observers to test other gateways against ArNS name resolution criteria and chunk/offset validation. This creates a self-regulating ecosystem with transparent, consensus-based performance evaluation. Architecture Overview The Observer Protocol operates through a systematic process where selected gateways monitor their peers and report findings to maintain network quality: Epoch Cycle and Responsibilities Each 24-hour epoch follows a structured process with specific responsibilities for gateways and observers: Epoch Start Smart Contract: Selects up to 50 observers using weighted random selection Smart Contract: Generates 2 prescribed ArNS names for all observers to test Selected Observers: Receive notification of selection and prescribed names Observation Phase Observers: Choose 8 additional ArNS names to test (total of 10 names per gateway) Observers: Select subset of gateways for chunk/offset validation based on sampling rate Observers: Test assigned gateways for ArNS resolution, wallet ownership, content hashes, and response times Observers: Validate chunk/offset data integrity using cryptographic Merkle proofs Target Gateways: Respond to resolution requests, serve content, and provide chunk data with proofs Reporting Phase Observers: Upload detailed JSON reports to Arweave for transparency Observers: Submit failed gateway lists to the AR.IO Smart Contract for consensus voting Evaluation and Distribution Smart Contract: Tallies all observer votes (≥50% pass = functional gateway) Smart Contract: Distributes rewards at epoch end based on performance Functional Gateways/Observers: Receive ARIO token rewards automatically Key Features Decentralized Monitoring: Peer-to-peer evaluation ensures no single point of failure Consensus-Based Scoring: Majority rule (≥50% pass votes) determines gateway functionality Performance Incentives: Only functional gateways and observers receive ARIO token rewards Data Integrity Validation: Cryptographic verification of chunk/offset data using Merkle proofs Transparent Accountability: All reports permanently stored on Arweave and viewable at gateways.ar.io Sustainable Funding: Protocol balance funded by ArNS name purchases, aligning rewards with network usage Chunk/Offset Validation The protocol includes advanced data integrity verification through chunk/offset observation.

By combining Arweave's immutable storage with AO's decentralized compute and AR.IO's accessible gateway network, the permaweb creates an internet where data never disappears, applications run without central points of failure, and users maintain true ownership of their digital assets. This architecture enables a new generation of applications that can operate indefinitely without relying on traditional hosting services, where digital artifacts become truly permanent, and where the collective knowledge of humanity is preserved for future generations.

A decentralized infrastructure layer built on Arweave and AO, making permanent data accessible, discoverable, and usable. Think of it as the gateway to Arweave's permaweb, turning its tamper-proof storage into a fully functional, user-friendly ecosystem for apps, websites, and data. Features of The AR.IO Network Gateways AR.IO operates a network of gateways — nodes that serve as entry points to Arweave’s data. These gateways fetch and deliver data quickly, supporting everything from static files to dynamic web apps. Arweave Name System (ArNS) The Arweave Name System (ArNS) is a decentralized naming system for Arweave. It allows users to register and resolve human-readable names to Arweave transaction IDs. Data Access AR.IO offers a range of tools for accessing and querying data on Arweave, including: HTTP Requests via gateways GraphQL Queries for finding data by tags and metadata ArNS for human-readable URLs Wayfinder for decentralized content discovery The Problem Arweave stores data forever, but accessing and organizing that data isn't always straightforward. Without efficient tools, retrieving files, serving websites, or finding specific content on Arweave's blockweave can be slow or complex, limiting its potential for developers and users. The Solution The AR.IO Network builds on Arweave's permanent storage to create a decentralized, scalable access layer. It provides gateways, domain names, and indexing services, making it easy to interact with permaweb content as seamlessly as the traditional web. How It Works Decentralized Gateways: AR.IO operates a network of gateways—nodes that serve as entry points to Arweave’s data. These gateways fetch and deliver data quickly, supporting everything from static files to dynamic web apps. ArNS (Arweave Name Service): AR.IO introduces decentralized domain names (e.g., yourname.arweave), mapping human-readable names to Arweave’s data IDs. This makes content easy to find and share, like URLs on the traditional web. Indexing and Querying: AR.IO enables efficient data indexing, allowing developers to search and retrieve specific content from Arweave’s vast storage without scanning the entire blockweave.

Think of it as a global, tamper-proof hard drive where your files—photos, documents, or apps—stay accessible forever. It's the foundation for the AR.IO Network, powering a \"permaweb\" where data never disappears. Below, we break down Arweave's core features in a simple, beginner-friendly way. A Datachain for Permanent Storage Arweave is like Bitcoin, but for data. It solves one problem really well: storing data permanently. Once uploaded, your data—whether a tweet, NFT, or website—is immutable and preserved indefinitely. How Does It Work? Blockweave Architecture: Unlike a blockchain's single chain, Arweave's blockweave links each new data block to the previous one and a random older block. Data is split into 256 KiB chunks in a secure Merkle tree, ensuring miners keep all data to add new blocks. Succinct Proofs of Random Access (SPoRA): Miners prove they store multiple data copies by accessing random chunks, verified efficiently with Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs). This combines proof-of-work and proof-of-storage, making data loss nearly impossible. In Simple Terms: Picture a library where new books reference older ones, and librarians must keep every book to add more. SPoRA ensures they prove they’ve got the books, keeping your data safe forever. Pay Once, Store Forever: No Recurring Fees Pay a one-time fee to upload data, and it's stored \"forever\"—no subscriptions or renewals. How Does It Work? Endowment Fund: Your fee, based on 200 years of storage for 20 replicas, goes mostly into a fund that slowly pays miners in AR tokens to maintain data. It assumes storage costs drop over time, making the fund sustainable. In Simple Terms: It's a “forever stamp” for data. Your payment funds a pot that keeps paying storage keepers, lasting longer as tech gets cheaper. Practically Unlimited Storage Arweave can practically store unlimited data, from small files to entire digital archives, without hitting a ceiling. The theoretical limit is 2^256 bytes which for scale is more atoms than there are in the universe. How Does It Work? Layer 1 Transactions: Data is stored as 256 KiB chunks on the blockweave, replicated across many nodes. As more nodes join with standard hardware, storage capacity grows limitlessly. Bundling with AR.IO Network and Turbo: Bundling packs multiple files into one transaction, reducing costs and congestion. AR.IO Network and Turbo (a Layer 2 tool) optimize this, enabling fast, cheap uploads of large datasets like websites. What Arweave doesn't solve well? Access Arweave solve's one problem and solve's it well. Storing your data for a very long-time. It doesn't, however, incentivise the indexing and access for data. Ready to Dive Deeper? Arweave powers a permaweb where apps, websites and data live forever. For AR.IO Network developers, it's the bedrock for unstoppable decentralized applications.

These approvals are created by uploading a signed data item with tags indicating the recipient's wallet address, the amount of Credits to share, and an optional amount of seconds that the approval will expire in. The recipient can then use the shared Credits to pay for their own uploads to Turbo. Shared Credits cannot be re-shared by the recipient to other recipients. Only the original owner of the Credits can share or revoke Credit Share Approvals. Credits that are shared to other wallets may not be used by the original owner of the Credits for sharing or uploading unless the Credit Share Approval is revoked or expired. Approvals can be revoked at any time by similarly uploading a signed data item with tags indicating the recipient's wallet address. This will remove all approvals and prevent the recipient from using the shared Credits. All unused Credits from expired or revoked approvals are returned to the original owner of the Credits. To use the shared Credits, recipient users must provide the wallet address of the user who shared the Credits with them in the x-paid-by HTTP header when uploading data. This tells Turbo services to look for and use Credit Share Approvals to pay for the upload before using the signer's balance. For user convenience, during upload the Turbo CLI will use any available Credit Share Approvals found for the connected wallet before using the signing wallet's balance. To instead ignore all Credit shares and only use the signer's balance, use the --ignore-approvals flag. To use the signer's balance first before using Credit shares, use the --use-signer-balance-first flag. In contrast, the Turbo SDK layer does not provide this functionality and will only use approvals when paidBy is provided. The Turbo SDK provides the following methods to manage Credit Share Approvals: shareCredits: Creates a Credit Share Approval for the specified wallet address and amount of Credits. revokeCredits: Revokes all Credit Share Approvals for the specified wallet address. listShares: Lists all Credit Share Approvals for the specified wallet address or connected wallet. dataItemOpts: { ...opts, paidBy: string[] }: Upload methods now accept 'paidBy', an array of wallet addresses that have provided credit share approvals to the user from which to pay, in the order provided and as necessary, for the upload. The Turbo CLI provides the following commands to manage Credit Share Approvals: share-credits: Creates a Credit Share Approval for the specified wallet address and amount of Credits. revoke-credits: Revokes all Credit Share Approvals for the specified wallet address. list-shares: Lists all Credit Share Approvals for the specified wallet address or connected wallet. paidBy: --paid-by : Upload commands now accept '--paid-by', an array of wallet addresses that have provided credit share approvals to the user from which to pay, in the order provided and as necessary, for the upload. --ignore-approvals: Ignore all Credit Share Approvals and only use the signer's balance. --use-signer-balance-first: Use the signer's balance first before using Credit Share Approvals.

The returned URL can be opened in the browser, all payments are processed by Stripe. Promo codes require an authenticated client. ```typescript const { url, winc, paymentAmount, quotedPaymentAmount, adjustments } = await turbo.createCheckoutSession({ amount: USD(10.0), // $10.00 USD owner: publicArweaveAddress, promoCodes: ['MY_PROMO_CODE'], // promo codes require an authenticated client }); // open checkout session in a browser window.open(url, '_blank'); ``` #### upload() The easiest way to upload data to Turbo. The `signal` is an optional [AbortSignal] that can be used to cancel the upload or timeout the request. `dataItemOpts` is an optional object that can be used to configure tags, target, and anchor for the data item upload. ```typescript const uploadResult = await turbo.upload({ data: 'The contents of my file!', signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000), // cancel the upload after 10 seconds dataItemOpts: { // optional }, events: { // optional }, }); ``` #### uploadFile() Signs and uploads a raw file. There are two ways to provide the file to the SDK: 1. Using a `file` parameter 2. Using a `fileStreamFactory` and `fileSizeFactory` ##### Using file` In Web with a file input: ```typescript const selectedFile = e.target.files[0]; const uploadResult = await turbo.uploadFile({ file: selectedFile, dataItemOpts: { tags: [{ name: 'Content-Type', value: 'text/plain' }], }, events: { onUploadProgress: ({ totalBytes, processedBytes }) => { console.log('Upload progress:', { totalBytes, processedBytes }); }, onUploadError: (error) => { console.log('Upload error:', { error }); }, onUploadSuccess: () => { console.log('Upload success!'); }, }, }); ``` In NodeJS with a file path: ```typescript const filePath = path.join(__dirname, './my-unsigned-file.txt'); const fileSize = fs.stateSync(filePath).size; const uploadResult = await turbo.uploadFile({ file: filePath, dataItemOpts: { tags: [{ name: 'Content-Type', value: 'text/plain' }], }, }); ``` ##### Using fileStreamFactory` and `fileSizeFactory` Note: The provided `fileStreamFactory` should produce a NEW file data stream each time it is invoked. The `fileSizeFactory` is a function that returns the size of the file. The `signal` is an optional [AbortSignal] that can be used to cancel the upload or timeout the request. `dataItemOpts` is an optional object that can be used to configure tags, target, and anchor for the data item upload. ```typescript const filePath = path.join(__dirname, './my-unsigned-file.txt'); const fileSize = fs.stateSync(filePath).size; const uploadResult = await turbo.uploadFile({ fileStreamFactory: () => fs.createReadStream(filePath), fileSizeFactory: () => fileSize, }); ``` ##### Customize Multi-Part Upload Behavior By default, the Turbo upload methods will split files that are larger than 10 MiB into chunks and send them to the upload service multi-part endpoints. This behavior can be customized with the following inputs: - `chunkByteCount`: The maximum size in bytes for each chunk. Must be between 5 MiB and 500 MiB. Defaults to 5 MiB. - `maxChunkConcurrency`: The maximum number of chunks to upload concurrently. Defaults to 5. Reducing concurrency will slow down uploads, but reduce memory utilization and serialize network calls. Increasing it will upload faster, but can strain available resources. - `chunkingMode`: The chunking mode to use. Can be 'auto', 'force', or 'disabled'. Defaults to 'auto'. Auto behavior means chunking is enabled if the file would be split into at least three chunks. - `maxFinalizeMs`: The maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the finalization of all chunks after the last chunk is uploaded. Defaults to 1 minute per GiB of the total file size. ```typescript // Customize chunking behavior await turbo.upload({ ...params, chunkByteCount: 1024 * 1024 * 500, // Max chunk size maxChunkConcurrency: 1, // Minimize concurrency }); ``` ```typescript // Disable chunking behavior await turbo.upload({ ...params, chunkingMode: 'disabled', }); ``` ```typescript // Force chunking behavior await turbo.upload({ ...params, chunkingMode: 'force', }); ``` #### On Demand Uploads With the upload methods, you can choose to Top Up with selected crypto token on demand if the connected wallet does not have enough credits to complete the upload. This is done by providing the `OnDemandFunding` class to the `fundingMode` parameter on upload methods. The `maxTokenAmount` (optional) is the maximum amount of tokens in the token type's smallest unit value (e.g: Winston for arweave token type) to fund the wallet with. The `topUpBufferMultiplier` (optional) is the multiplier to apply to the estimated top-up amount to avoid underpayment during on-demand top-ups due to price fluctuations on longer uploads. Defaults to 1.1, meaning a 10% buffer. Note: On demand API currently only available for $ARIO (`ario`), $SOL (`solana`), and $ETH on Base Network (`base-eth`) token types. ```typescript const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer: arweaveSignerWithARIO, token: 'ario', }); await turbo.upload({ ...params, fundingMode: new OnDemandFunding({ maxTokenAmount: ARIOToTokenAmount(500), // Max 500 $ARIO topUpBufferMultiplier: 1.1, // 10% buffer to avoid underpayment }), }); ``` #### uploadFolder() Signs and uploads a folder of files. For NodeJS, the `folderPath` of the folder to upload is required. For the browser, an array of `files` is required. The `dataItemOpts` is an optional object that can be used to configure tags, target, and anchor for the data item upload. The `signal` is an optional [AbortSignal] that can be used to cancel the upload or timeout the request. The `maxConcurrentUploads` is an optional number that can be used to limit the number of concurrent uploads. The `throwOnFailure` is an optional boolean that can be used to throw an error if any upload fails. The `manifestOptions` is an optional object that can be used to configure the manifest file, including a custom index file, fallback file, or whether to disable manifests altogether. Manifests are enabled by default. ##### NodeJS Upload Folder ```typescript const folderPath = path.join(__dirname, './my-folder'); const { manifest, fileResponses, manifestResponse } = await turbo.uploadFolder({ folderPath, dataItemOpts: { // optional tags: [ { // User defined content type will overwrite file content type name: 'Content-Type', value: 'text/plain', }, { name: 'My-Custom-Tag', value: 'my-custom-value', }, ], // no timeout or AbortSignal provided }, manifestOptions: { // optional indexFile: 'custom-index.html', fallbackFile: 'custom-fallback.html', disableManifests: false, }, }); ``` ##### Browser Upload Folder ```html const folderInput = document.getElementById('folder'); folderInput.addEventListener('change', async (event) => { const selectedFiles = folderInput.files; console.log('Folder selected:', selectedFiles); const { manifest, fileResponses, manifestResponse } = await turbo.uploadFolder({ files: Array.from(selectedFiles).map((file) => file), }); console.log(manifest, fileResponses, manifestResponse); }); ``` #### topUpWithTokens() Tops up the connected wallet with Credits by submitting a payment transaction for the token amount to the Turbo wallet and then submitting that transaction id to Turbo Payment Service for top up processing. - The `tokenAmount` is the amount of tokens in the token type's smallest unit value (e.g: Winston for arweave token type) to fund the wallet with. - The `feeMultiplier` (optional) is the multiplier to apply to the reward for the transaction to modify its chances of being mined. Credits will be added to the wallet balance after the transaction is confirmed on the given blockchain. Defaults to 1.0, meaning no multiplier. ##### Arweave (AR) Crypto Top Up ```typescript const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer, token: 'arweave' }); const { winc, status, id, ...fundResult } = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({ tokenAmount: WinstonToTokenAmount(100_000_000), // 0.0001 AR feeMultiplier: 1.1, // 10% increase in reward for improved mining chances }); ``` ##### AR.IO Network (ARIO) Crypto Top Up ```typescript const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer, token: 'ario' }); const { winc, status, id, ...fundResult } = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({ tokenAmount: ARIOToTokenAmount(100), // 100 $ARIO }); ``` ##### Ethereum (ETH) Crypto Top Up ```typescript const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer, token: 'ethereum' }); const { winc, status, id, ...fundResult } = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({ tokenAmount: ETHToTokenAmount(0.00001), // 0.00001 ETH }); ``` ##### Polygon (POL / MATIC) Crypto Top Up ```typescript const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer, token: 'pol' }); const { winc, status, id, ...fundResult } = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({ tokenAmount: POLToTokenAmount(0.00001), // 0.00001 POL }); ``` ##### Eth on Base Network Crypto Top Up ```typescript const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer, token: 'base-eth' }); const { winc, status, id, ...fundResult } = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({ tokenAmount: ETHToTokenAmount(0.00001), // 0.00001 ETH bridged on Base Network }); ``` ##### Solana (SOL) Crypto Top Up ```typescript const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer, token: 'solana' }); const { winc, status, id, ...fundResult } = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({ tokenAmount: SOLToTokenAmount(0.00001), // 0.00001 SOL }); ``` ##### KYVE Crypto Top Up ```typescript const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer, token: 'kyve' }); const { winc, status, id, ...fundResult } = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({ tokenAmount: KYVEToTokenAmount(0.00001), // 0.00001 KYVE }); ``` #### shareCredits() Shares credits from the connected wallet to the provided native address and approved winc amount. This action will create a signed data item for the approval ```typescript const { approvalDataItemId, approvedWincAmount } = await turbo.shareCredits({ approvedAddress: '2cor...VUa', approvedWincAmount: 800_000_000_000, // 0.8 Credits expiresBySeconds: 3600, // Credits will expire back to original wallet in 1 hour }); ``` #### revokeCredits() Revokes all credits shared from the connected wallet to the provided native address. ```typescript const revokedApprovals = await turbo.revokeCredits({ revokedAddress: '2cor...VUa', }); ``` #### getCreditShareApprovals() Returns all given or received credit share approvals for the connected wallet or the provided native address. ```typescript const { givenApprovals, receivedApprovals } = await turbo.getCreditShareApprovals({ userAddress: '2cor...VUa', }); ``` # TurboFactory (/(apis)/turbofactory) #### unauthenticated() Creates an instance of a client that accesses Turbo's unauthenticated services. ```typescript const turbo = TurboFactory.unauthenticated(); ``` #### authenticated() Creates an instance of a client that accesses Turbo's authenticated and unauthenticated services.

The provided `dataItemStreamFactory` should produce a NEW signed data item stream each time is it invoked. The `dataItemSizeFactory` is a function that returns the size of the file. The `signal` is an optional [AbortSignal] that can be used to cancel the upload or timeout the request. The `events` parameter is an optional object that can be used to listen to upload progress, errors, and success (refer to the [Events] section for more details). ```typescript const filePath = path.join(__dirname, './my-signed-data-item'); const dataItemSize = fs.statSync(filePath).size; const uploadResponse = await turbo.uploadSignedDataItem({ dataItemStreamFactory: () => fs.createReadStream(filePath), dataItemSizeFactory: () => dataItemSize, signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000), // cancel the upload after 10 seconds events: { // track upload events only onUploadProgress: ({ totalBytes, processedBytes }) => { console.log('Upload progress:', { totalBytes, processedBytes }); }, onUploadError: (error) => { console.log('Upload error:', { error }); }, onUploadSuccess: () => { console.log('Upload success!'); }, }, }); ``` #### createCheckoutSession() Creates a Stripe checkout session for a Turbo Top Up with the provided amount, currency, owner.

The `txId` is the transaction ID of the transaction to be submitted. Use this API if you've already executed your token transfer to the Turbo wallet. Otherwise, consider using `topUpWithTokens` to execute a new token transfer to the Turbo wallet and submit its resulting transaction ID for top up processing all in one go ```typescript const turbo = TurboFactory.unauthenticated(); // defaults to arweave token type const { status, id, ...fundResult } = await turbo.submitFundTransaction({ txId: 'my-valid-arweave-fund-transaction-id', }); ``` # Events (/events) The SDK provides events for tracking the state signing and uploading data to Turbo. You can listen to these events by providing a callback function to the `events` parameter of the `upload`, `uploadFile`, and `uploadSignedDataItem` methods. - `onProgress` - emitted when the overall progress changes (includes both upload and signing). Each event consists of the total bytes, processed bytes, and the step (upload or signing) - `onError` - emitted when the overall upload or signing fails (includes both upload and signing) - `onSuccess` - emitted when the overall upload or signing succeeds (includes both upload and signing) - this is the last event emitted for the upload or signing process - `onSigningProgress` - emitted when the signing progress changes. - `onSigningError` - emitted when the signing fails. - `onSigningSuccess` - emitted when the signing succeeds - `onUploadProgress` - emitted when the upload progress changes - `onUploadError` - emitted when the upload fails - `onUploadSuccess` - emitted when the upload succeeds ```typescript const uploadResult = await turbo.upload({ data: 'The contents of my file!', signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000), // cancel the upload after 10 seconds dataItemOpts: { // optional }, events: { // overall events (includes signing and upload events) onProgress: ({ totalBytes, processedBytes, step }) => { const percentComplete = (processedBytes / totalBytes) * 100; console.log('Overall progress:', { totalBytes, processedBytes, step, percentComplete: percentComplete.toFixed(2) + '%', // eg 50.68% }); }, onError: (error) => { console.log('Overall error:', { error }); }, onSuccess: () => { console.log('Signed and upload data item!'); }, // upload events onUploadProgress: ({ totalBytes, processedBytes }) => { console.log('Upload progress:', { totalBytes, processedBytes }); }, onUploadError: (error) => { console.log('Upload error:', { error }); }, onUploadSuccess: () => { console.log('Upload success!'); }, // signing events onSigningProgress: ({ totalBytes, processedBytes }) => { console.log('Signing progress:', { totalBytes, processedBytes }); }, onSigningError: (error) => { console.log('Signing error:', { error }); }, onSigningSuccess: () => { console.log('Signing success!'); }, }, }); ``` # Turbo SDK (/index) **For AI and LLM users**: Access the complete Turbo SDK documentation in plain text format at llm.txt for easy consumption by AI agents and language models. # Turbo SDK Please refer to the [source code](https://github.com/ardriveapp/turbo-sdk) for SDK details. # Logging (/logging) The SDK uses winston for logging. You can set the log level using the `setLogLevel` method. ```typescript TurboFactory.setLogLevel('debug'); ``` # Turbo Credit Sharing (/turbo-credit-sharing) Users can share their purchased Credits with other users' wallets by creating Credit Share Approvals. These approvals are created by uploading a signed data item with tags indicating the recipient's wallet address, the amount of Credits to share, and an optional amount of seconds that the approval will expire in. The recipient can then use the shared Credits to pay for their own uploads to Turbo. Shared Credits cannot be re-shared by the recipient to other recipients. Only the original owner of the Credits can share or revoke Credit Share Approvals. Credits that are shared to other wallets may not be used by the original owner of the Credits for sharing or uploading unless the Credit Share Approval is revoked or expired. Approvals can be revoked at any time by similarly uploading a signed data item with tags indicating the recipient's wallet address. This will remove all approvals and prevent the recipient from using the shared Credits. All unused Credits from expired or revoked approvals are returned to the original owner of the Credits. To use the shared Credits, recipient users must provide the wallet address of the user who shared the Credits with them in the `x-paid-by` HTTP header when uploading data. This tells Turbo services to look for and use Credit Share Approvals to pay for the upload before using the signer's balance. For user convenience, during upload the Turbo CLI will use any available Credit Share Approvals found for the connected wallet before using the signing wallet's balance. To instead ignore all Credit shares and only use the signer's balance, use the `--ignore-approvals` flag. To use the signer's balance first before using Credit shares, use the `--use-signer-balance-first` flag. In contrast, the Turbo SDK layer does not provide this functionality and will only use approvals when `paidBy` is provided. The Turbo SDK provides the following methods to manage Credit Share Approvals: - `shareCredits`: Creates a Credit Share Approval for the specified wallet address and amount of Credits. - `revokeCredits`: Revokes all Credit Share Approvals for the specified wallet address. - `listShares`: Lists all Credit Share Approvals for the specified wallet address or connected wallet. - `dataItemOpts: { ...opts, paidBy: string[] }`: Upload methods now accept 'paidBy', an array of wallet addresses that have provided credit share approvals to the user from which to pay, in the order provided and as necessary, for the upload. The Turbo CLI provides the following commands to manage Credit Share Approvals: - `share-credits`: Creates a Credit Share Approval for the specified wallet address and amount of Credits. - `revoke-credits`: Revokes all Credit Share Approvals for the specified wallet address. - `list-shares`: Lists all Credit Share Approvals for the specified wallet address or connected wallet. - `paidBy: --paid-by `: Upload commands now accept '--paid-by', an array of wallet addresses that have provided credit share approvals to the user from which to pay, in the order provided and as necessary, for the upload. - `--ignore-approvals`: Ignore all Credit Share Approvals and only use the signer's balance. - `--use-signer-balance-first`: Use the signer's balance first before using Credit Share Approvals.","estimatedWords":3505,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:09:07.594Z","breadcrumbs":["sdks","turbo sdk","llm.txt"],"siteKey":"ario","siteName":"AR-IO Network","depth":3,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:09:07.594Z"},{"url":"https://docs.ar.io/sdks/ar-io-sdk/pagination","title":"Pagination","content":"AR.IO SDKPaginationCopy MarkdownOpenOverview Certain APIs that could return a large amount of data are paginated using cursors. The SDK uses the cursor pattern (as opposed to pages) to better protect against changing data while paginating through a list of items. For more information on pagination strategies refer to this article. Paginated results include the following properties: items: the list of items on the current request, defaulted to 100 items. nextCursor: the cursor to use for the next batch of items. This is undefined if there are no more items to fetch. hasMore: a boolean indicating if there are more items to fetch. This is false if there are no more items to fetch. totalItems: the total number of items available. This may change as new items are added to the list, only use this for informational purposes. sortBy: the field used to sort the items, by default this is startTimestamp. sortOrder: the order used to sort the items, by default this is desc. To request all the items in a list, you can iterate through the list using the nextCursor until hasMore is false. let hasMore = true; let cursor: string | undefined; while (hasMore) { gateaways.push(...items); cursor = page.nextCursor; hasMore = page.hasMore; } Filtering Paginated APIs also support filtering by providing a filters parameter. Filters can be applied to any field in the response. When multiple keys are provided, they are treated as AND conditions (all conditions must match). When multiple values are provided for a single key (as an array), they are treated as OR conditions (any value can match).

With vast amounts of data generated by decentralized physical infrastructure networks, traditional on-chain storage is prohibitively expensive, yet networks need reliable, long-term access to their device data. Arweave via AR.IO Network provides chain-agnostic, permanent and immutable storage for a one-time fee, ensuring networks can access any device data previously stored and verify it has not been tampered with. Getting Started with DePIN Data Storage Prepare Your Data StructureOrganize your DePIN device data in a consistent format. Here's an example for environmental sensor data:{ \"device_id\": \"airmon-007\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-09-22T14:31:05Z\", \"location\": { \"lat\": 51.5098, \"lon\": -0.118 }, \"pm25\": 16, \"co2_ppm\": 412, \"noise_dB\": 41.2 }Best Practices: Use consistent field names across all devices Include timestamps in ISO format Add device identifiers for tracking Consider data compression for large datasets Tag Your Data for DiscoveryProper tagging is essential for finding your data later. Consider these tags for DePIN data:{ \"name\": \"App-Name\", \"value\": \"AirQuality-DePIN-v1.0\" }, { \"name\": \"Device-ID\", \"value\": \"airmon-007\" }, { \"name\": \"Device-Type\", \"value\": \"Environmental-Sensor\" }, { \"name\": \"Network-Name\", \"value\": \"AirQuality-Network\" }, { \"name\": \"Data-Category\", \"value\": \"Air-Quality\" }, { \"name\": \"Location\", \"value\": \"London-UK\" }, { \"name\": \"Device-Timestamp\", \"value\": \"2025-09-22T14:31:05Z\" }Tagging Strategy: Use consistent naming conventions Include geographic identifiers Add device type classifications Include data categories for filtering For more detailed information on tagging, see our Tagging documentationUpload to ArweaveSelect the best method for your DePIN network's needs:Turbo SDKTurbo CLIimport { TurboFactory } from '@ardrive/turbo-sdk'","estimatedWords":247,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:09:39.478Z","breadcrumbs":["build","guides","depin"],"siteKey":"ario","siteName":"AR-IO Network","depth":4,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:09:39.478Z"},{"url":"https://docs.ar.io/build/guides/deploy-dapp-with-ardrive-web","title":"Deploy a dApp with ArDrive Web","content":"GuidesDeploy a dApp with ArDrive WebCopy MarkdownOpenCreate permanent dApps using the ArDrive web interface.

This is used for upgrading ANTs to new versions. ```typescript const newProcessId = await ANT.fork({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk), antProcessId: 'existing-ant-process-id', // Optional: specify a specific module ID, defaults to latest from registry module: 'new-module-id', onSigningProgress: (event, payload) => { console.log(`Fork progress: ${event}`); }, }); console.log(`Forked ANT to new process: ${newProcessId}`); ``` #### ANT.upgrade() Static method to upgrade an ANT by forking it to the latest version and reassigning names. ```typescript // Upgrade and reassign all affiliated names const result = await ANT.upgrade({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk), antProcessId: 'existing-ant-process-id', reassignAffiliatedNames: true, arioProcessId: ARIO_MAINNET_PROCESS_ID }); // Upgrade and reassign specific names const result = await ANT.upgrade({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk), antProcessId: 'existing-ant-process-id', names: ['ardrive', 'example'], reassignAffiliatedNames: false, arioProcessId: ARIO_MAINNET_PROCESS_ID }); console.log(`Upgraded to process: ${result.forkedProcessId}`); console.log(`Successfully reassigned names: ${Object.keys(result.reassignedNames)}`); console.log(`Failed reassignments: ${Object.keys(result.failedReassignedNames)}`); ``` # Transfer (/(ant-contracts)/transfer) #### transfer() Transfers ownership of the ANT to a new target address. Target MUST be an Arweave address. _Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ANT.init` to sign the transaction._ ```typescript const { id: txId } = await ant.transfer( { target: 'aGzM_yjralacHIUo8_nQXMbh9l1cy0aksiL_x9M359f' }, // optional additional tags { tags: [{ name: 'App-Name', value: 'My-Awesome-App' }] }, ); ``` # Undername Ownership (/(ant-contracts)/undername-ownership) NTs support ownership of undernames: 1. **ANT Owner** - Has full control over the ANT and all records 2. **Controllers** - Can manage records but cannot transfer ANT ownership 3. **Record Owners** - Can only update their specific delegated records When a record owner updates their own record, they **MUST** include their own address in the `owner` field. If the `owner` field is omitted or set to a different address, the record ownership will be transferred or renounced. #### transferRecord() Transfers ownership of a specific record (undername) to another address. This enables delegation of control for individual records within an ANT while maintaining the ANT owner's ultimate authority. The current record owner or ANT owner/controllers can transfer ownership. _Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ANT.init` to sign the transaction._ ```typescript const { id: txId } = await ant.transferRecord({ undername: 'alice', // the subdomain/record to transfer recipient: 'new-owner-address-123...', // address of the new owner }); // alice_ardrive.ar.io is now owned by the new owner address // The new owner can update the record but not other records in the ANT ``` **CLI Usage:** ```bash ar.io transfer-record \\ --process-id \"ANT_PROCESS_ID\" \\ --undername \"alice\" \\ --recipient \"new-owner-address-123...\" \\ --wallet-file \"path/to/wallet.json\" ``` #### Record Owner Workflow Examples **Checking Record Ownership:** ```typescript const record = await ant.getRecord({ undername: 'alice' }); console.log(`Record owner: ${record.owner}`); console.log(`Transaction ID: ${record.transactionId}`); ``` **Record Owner Updating Their Own Record:** ```typescript // Alice (record owner) updating her own record const aliceAnt = ANT.init({ processId: 'ANT_PROCESS_ID', signer: new ArweaveSigner(aliceJwk), // Alice's wallet }); // ✅ CORRECT: Alice includes her own address as owner const { id: txId } = await aliceAnt.setUndernameRecord({ undername: 'alice', transactionId: 'new-content-tx-id-456...', ttlSeconds: 1800, owner: 'alice-wallet-address-123...', // MUST be Alice's own address displayName: 'Alice Updated Portfolio', description: 'Updated personal portfolio and blog', }); // ❌ WRONG: Omitting owner field will renounce ownership const badUpdate = await aliceAnt.setUndernameRecord({ undername: 'alice', transactionId: 'new-content-tx-id-456...', ttlSeconds: 1800, // Missing owner field - this will renounce ownership! }); // ❌ WRONG: Setting different owner will transfer ownership const badTransfer = await aliceAnt.setUndernameRecord({ undername: 'alice', transactionId: 'new-content-tx-id-456...', ttlSeconds: 1800, owner: 'someone-else-address-789...', // This transfers ownership to someone else! }); ``` **What Happens When Record Ownership is Renounced:** If a record owner updates their record without including the `owner` field, the record becomes owned by the ANT owner/controllers again: ```typescript // Before: alice record is owned by alice-wallet-address-123... const recordBefore = await ant.getRecord({ undername: 'alice' }); console.log(recordBefore.owner); // \"alice-wallet-address-123...\" // Alice updates without owner field await aliceAnt.setUndernameRecord({ undername: 'alice', transactionId: 'new-tx-id...', ttlSeconds: 900, // No owner field = renounces ownership }); // After: record ownership reverts to ANT owner const recordAfter = await ant.getRecord({ undername: 'alice' }); console.log(recordAfter.owner); // undefined (controlled by ANT owner again) ``` # Upgrade (/(ant-contracts)/upgrade) #### upgrade() Upgrades an ANT by forking it to the latest version from the ANT registry and optionally reassigning ArNS names to the new process. This function first checks the version of the existing ANT, creates a new ANT using `.fork()` to the latest version, and then reassigns the ArNS names affiliated with this process to the new process. _Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ANT.init` to sign the transaction._ ```typescript // Upgrade ANT and reassign all affiliated ArNS names to the new process const result = await ant.upgrade(); // Upgrade ANT and reassign specific ArNS names to the new process const result = await ant.upgrade({ names: ['ardrive', 'example'], }); // with callbacks const result = await ant.upgrade({ names: ['ardrive', 'example'], onSigningProgress: (event, payload) => { console.log(`${event}:`, payload); if (event === 'checking-version') { console.log(`Checking version: ${payload.antProcessId}`); } if (event === 'fetching-affiliated-names') { console.log(`Fetching affiliated names: ${payload.arioProcessId}`); } if (event === 'reassigning-name') { console.log(`Reassigning name: ${payload.name}`); } if (event === 'validating-names') { console.log(`Validating names: ${payload.names}`); } // other callback events... }, }); console.log(`Upgraded to process: ${result.forkedProcessId}`); console.log(`Successfully reassigned names: ${result.reassignedNames}`); console.log(`Failed to reassign names: ${result.failedReassignedNames}`); ``` **Parameters:** - `reassignAffiliatedNames?: boolean` - If true, reassigns all names associated with this process to the new forked process (defaults to true when names is empty) - `names?: string[]` - Optional array of specific names to reassign (cannot be used with `reassignAffiliatedNames: true`). These names must be affiliated with this ANT on the provided ARIO process. - `arioProcessId?: string` - Optional ARIO process ID (defaults to mainnet) - `antRegistryId?: string` - Optional ANT registry process ID used to resolve the latest version (defaults to mainnet registry) - `skipVersionCheck?: boolean` - Skip checking if ANT is already latest version (defaults to false) - `onSigningProgress?: Function` - Optional progress callback for tracking upgrade steps **Returns:** `Promise, failedReassignedNames: Record }>` # Versions (/(ant-contracts)/versions) #### getModuleId() Gets the module ID of the current ANT process by querying its spawn transaction tags. Results are cached after the first successful fetch. ```typescript const moduleId = await ant.getModuleId(); console.log(`ANT was spawned with module: ${moduleId}`); // With custom GraphQL URL and retries const moduleId = await ant.getModuleId({ graphqlUrl: 'https://arweave.net/graphql', retries: 5 }); ``` **Output:** ```json \"FKtQtOOtlcWCW2pXrwWFiCSlnuewMZOHCzhulVkyqBE\" ``` #### getVersion() Gets the version string of the current ANT by matching its module ID with versions from the ANT registry. ```typescript const version = await ant.getVersion(); console.log(`ANT is running version: ${version}`); // With custom ANT registry const version = await ant.getVersion({ antRegistryId: 'custom-ant-registry-id' }); ``` **Output:** ```json \"23\" ``` #### isLatestVersion() Checks if the current ANT version is the latest according to the ANT registry. ```typescript const isLatest = await ant.isLatestVersion(); if (!isLatest) { console.log('ANT can be upgraded to the latest version'); } ``` **Output:** ```json true ``` #### getANTVersions Static method that returns the full array of available ANT versions and the latest version from the ANT registry. ```typescript // Get all available ANT versions const antVersions = ANT.versions; const versions = await antVersions.getANTVersions(); ``` Result: ```json { [ { \"moduleId\": \"FKtQtOOtlcWCW2pXrwWFiCSlnuewMZOHCzhulVkyqBE\", \"version\": \"23\", \"releaseNotes\": \"Initial release of the ANT module.\", \"releaseDate\": 1700000000000 } // ...other versions ], } ``` #### getLatestANTVersion() Static method that returns the latest ANT version from the ANT registry. ```typescript // Get the latest ANT version // Get all available ANT versions const antVersions = ANT.versions; const versions = await antVersions.getANTVersions(); const latestVersion = await antVersions.getLatestANTVersion(); ``` Result: ```json { \"moduleId\": \"FKtQtOOtlcWCW2pXrwWFiCSlnuewMZOHCzhulVkyqBE\", \"version\": \"23\", \"releaseNotes\": \"Initial release of the ANT module.\", \"releaseDate\": 1700000000000 } ``` # Arweave Name System (ArNS) (/(ario-contract)/arweave-name-system-arns) #### resolveArNSName() Resolves an ArNS name to the underlying data id stored on the names corresponding ANT id. ##### Resolving a base name ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); const record = await ario.resolveArNSName({ name: 'ardrive' }); ``` **Output:** ```json { \"processId\": \"bh9l1cy0aksiL_x9M359faGzM_yjralacHIUo8_nQXM\", \"txId\": \"kvhEUsIY5bXe0Wu2-YUFz20O078uYFzmQIO-7brv8qw\", \"type\": \"lease\", \"recordIndex\": 0, \"undernameLimit\": 100, \"owner\": \"t4Xr0_J4Iurt7caNST02cMotaz2FIbWQ4Kbj616RHl3\", \"name\": \"ardrive\" } ``` ##### Resolving an undername ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); const record = await ario.resolveArNSName({ name: 'logo_ardrive' }); ``` **Output:** ```json { \"processId\": \"bh9l1cy0aksiL_x9M359faGzM_yjralacHIUo8_nQXM\", \"txId\": \"kvhEUsIY5bXe0Wu2-YUFz20O078uYFzmQIO-7brv8qw\", \"type\": \"lease\", \"recordIndex\": 1, \"undernameLimit\": 100, \"owner\": \"t4Xr0_J4Iurt7caNST02cMotaz2FIbWQ4Kbj616RHl3\", \"name\": \"ardrive\" } ``` #### buyRecord() Purchases a new ArNS record with the specified name, type, processId, and duration. _Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ARIO.init` to sign the transaction._ **Arguments:** - `name` - _required_: the name of the ArNS record to purchase - `type` - _required_: the type of ArNS record to purchase - `processId` - _optional_: the process id of an existing ANT process.

Must be executed with a wallet registered as a gateway operator. Requires `signer` to be provided on `ARIO.init` to sign the transaction. _Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ARIO.init` to sign the transaction._ ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk) }); const { id: txId } = await ario.decreaseOperatorStake( { qty: new ARIOToken(100).toMARIO(), }, { tags: [{ name: 'App-Name', value: 'My-Awesome-App' }], }, ); ``` #### redelegateStake() Redelegates the stake of a specific address to a new gateway. Vault ID may be optionally included in order to redelegate from an existing withdrawal vault. The redelegation fee is calculated based on the fee rate and the stake amount. Users are allowed one free redelegation every seven epochs. Each additional redelegation beyond the free redelegation will increase the fee by 10%, capping at a 60% redelegation fee. e.g: If 1000 mARIO is redelegated and the fee rate is 10%, the fee will be 100 mARIO. Resulting in 900 mARIO being redelegated to the new gateway and 100 mARIO being deducted back to the protocol balance. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk) }); const { id: txId } = await ario.redelegateStake({ target: 't4Xr0_J4Iurt7caNST02cMotaz2FIbWQ4Kbj616RHl3', source: 'HwFceQaMQnOBgKDpnFqCqgwKwEU5LBme1oXRuQOWSRA', stakeQty: new ARIOToken(1000).toMARIO(), vaultId: 'fDrr0_J4Iurt7caNST02cMotaz2FIbWQ4Kcj616RHl3', }); ``` #### getRedelegationFee() Retrieves the fee rate as percentage required to redelegate the stake of a specific address. Fee rate ranges from 0% to 60% based on the number of redelegations since the last fee reset. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); const fee = await ario.getRedelegationFee({ address: 't4Xr0_J4Iurt7caNST02cMotaz2FIbWQ4Kbj616RHl3', }); ``` **Output:** ```json { \"redelegationFeeRate\": 10, \"feeResetTimestamp\": 1730996691117 } ``` #### getAllDelegates() Retrieves all delegates across all gateways, paginated and sorted by the specified criteria. The `cursor` used for pagination is a `cursorId` derived from delegate address and the gatewayAddress from the previous request. e.g `address_gatewayAddress`. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); const delegates = await ario.getAllDelegates({ limit: 2, sortBy: 'startTimestamp', sortOrder: 'desc', }); ``` **Output:** ```json { \"sortOrder\": \"desc\", \"hasMore\": true, \"totalItems\": 95, \"limit\": 2, \"sortBy\": \"startTimestamp\", \"items\": [ { \"startTimestamp\": 1734709397622, \"cursorId\": \"9jfM0uzGNc9Mkhjo1ixGoqM7ygSem9wx_EokiVgi0Bs_E-QVU3dta36Wia2uQw6tQLjQk7Qw5uN0Z6fUzsoqzUc\", \"gatewayAddress\": \"E-QVU3dta36Wia2uQw6tQLjQk7Qw5uN0Z6fUzsoqzUc\", \"address\": \"9jfM0uzGNc9Mkhjo1ixGoqM7ygSem9wx_EokiVgi0Bs\", \"delegatedStake\": 2521349108, \"vaultedStake\": 0 }, { \"startTimestamp\": 1734593229454, \"cursorId\": \"LtV0aSqgK3YI7c5FmfvZd-wG95TJ9sezj_a4syaLMS8_M0WP8KSzCvKpzC-HPF1WcddLgGaL9J4DGi76iMnhrN4\", \"gatewayAddress\": \"M0WP8KSzCvKpzC-HPF1WcddLgGaL9J4DGi76iMnhrN4\", \"address\": \"LtV0aSqgK3YI7c5FmfvZd-wG95TJ9sezj_a4syaLMS8\", \"delegatedStake\": 1685148110, \"vaultedStake\": 10000000 } ], \"nextCursor\": \"PZ5vIhHf8VY969TxBPQN-rYY9CNFP9ggNsMBqlWUzWM_QGWqtJdLLgm2ehFWiiPzMaoFLD50CnGuzZIPEdoDRGQ\" } ``` # General (/(ario-contract)/general) #### init() Factory function to that creates a read-only or writeable client. By providing a `signer` additional write APIs that require signing, like `joinNetwork` and `delegateStake` are available. By default, a read-only client is returned and no write APIs are available. ```typescript // read-only client const ario = ARIO.init(); // read-write client for browser environments const ario = ARIO.init({ signer: new ArConnectSigner(window.arweaveWallet, Arweave.init({}))}); // read-write client for node environments const ario = ARIO.init({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(JWK) }); ``` #### getInfo() Retrieves the information of the ARIO process. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); const info = await ario.getInfo(); ``` **Output:** ```json { \"Name\": \"ARIO\", \"Ticker\": \"ARIO\", \"Owner\": \"QGWqtJdLLgm2ehFWiiPzMaoFLD50CnGuzZIPEdoDRGQ\", \"Denomination\": 6, \"Handlers\": [\"_eval\", \"_default_\"], // full list of handlers, useful for debugging \"LastCreatedEpochIndex\": 31, // epoch index of the last tick \"LastDistributedEpochIndex\": 31 // epoch index of the last distribution } ``` #### getTokenSupply() Retrieves the total supply of tokens, returned in mARIO. The total supply includes the following: - `total` - the total supply of all tokens - `circulating` - the total supply minus locked, withdrawn, delegated, and staked - `locked` - tokens that are locked in the protocol (a.k.a. vaulted) - `withdrawn` - tokens that have been withdrawn from the protocol by operators and delegators - `delegated` - tokens that have been delegated to gateways - `staked` - tokens that are staked in the protocol by gateway operators - `protocolBalance` - tokens that are held in the protocol's treasury. This is included in the circulating supply. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); const supply = await ario.getTokenSupply(); ``` **Output:** ```json { \"total\": 1000000000000000000, \"circulating\": 998094653842520, \"locked\": 0, \"withdrawn\": 560563387278, \"delegated\": 1750000000, \"staked\": 1343032770199, \"protocolBalance\": 46317263683761 } ``` #### getBalance() Retrieves the balance of the specified wallet address. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); // the balance will be returned in mARIO as a value const balance = await ario .getBalance({ address: 'QGWqtJdLLgm2ehFWiiPzMaoFLD50CnGuzZIPEdoDRGQ', }) .then((balance: number) => new mARIOToken(balance).toARIO()); // convert it to ARIO for readability ``` **Output:** ```json 100000 ``` #### getBalances() Retrieves the balances of the ARIO process in `mARIO`, paginated and sorted by the specified criteria. The `cursor` used for pagination is the last wallet address from the previous request. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); const balances = await ario.getBalances({ cursor: '-4xgjroXENKYhTWqrBo57HQwvDL51mMdfsdsxJy6Y2Z_sA', limit: 100, sortBy: 'balance', sortOrder: 'desc', }); ``` **Output:** ```json { \"items\": [ { \"address\": \"-4xgjroXENKYhTWqrBo57HQwvDL51mMvSxJy6Y2Z_sA\", \"balance\": 1000000 }, { \"address\": \"-7vXsQZQDk8TMDlpiSLy3CnLi5PDPlAaN2DaynORpck\", \"balance\": 1000000 } // ...98 other balances ], \"hasMore\": true, \"nextCursor\": \"-7vXsQZQDk8TMDlpiSLy3CnLi5PDPlAaN2DaynORpck\", \"totalItems\": 1789, \"sortBy\": \"balance\", \"sortOrder\": \"desc\" } ``` #### transfer() Transfers `mARIO` to the designated `target` recipient address. Requires `signer` to be provided on `ARIO.init` to sign the transaction. _Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ARIO.init` to sign the transaction._ ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk), }); const { id: txId } = await ario.transfer( { target: '-5dV7nk7waR8v4STuwPnTck1zFVkQqJh5K9q9Zik4Y5', qty: new ARIOToken(1000).toMARIO(), }, // optional additional tags { tags: [{ name: 'App-Name', value: 'My-Awesome-App' }] }, ); ``` # Networks (/(ario-contract)/networks) The SDK provides the following process IDs for the mainnet and testnet environments: - `ARIO_MAINNET_PROCESS_ID` - Mainnet ARIO process ID (production) - `ARIO_TESTNET_PROCESS_ID` - Testnet ARIO process ID (testing and development) - `ARIO_DEVNET_PROCESS_ID` - Devnet ARIO process ID (development) As of `v3.8.1` the SDK defaults all API interactions to **mainnet**. To use the **testnet** or **devnet** provide the appropriate `ARIO_TESTNET_PROCESS_ID` or `ARIO_DEVNET_PROCESS_ID` when initializing the client. #### Mainnet As of `v3.8.1` the SDK defaults all API interactions to **mainnet**. To use the **testnet** or **devnet** provide the appropriate `ARIO_TESTNET_PROCESS_ID` or `ARIO_DEVNET_PROCESS_ID` when initializing the client. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); // or ARIO.init() ``` #### Testnet ```typescript const testnet = ARIO.testnet(); // or ARIO.init({ processId: ARIO_TESTNET_PROCESS_ID }) ``` ##### Faucet The SDK provides APIs for claiming tokens via a faucet on the AR.IO Testnet process (`tARIO`) via the [ar-io-testnet-faucet] service. All token requests require a captcha to be solved, and the faucet is rate limited to prevent abuse. To claim testnet tokens from the testnet token faucet, you can use one of the following methods: 1. Visit [faucet.ar.io](https://faucet.ar.io) - the easiest way to quickly get tokens for testing for a single address. 2. Programmatically via the SDK - useful if you need to claim tokens for multiple addresses or dynamically within your application. - `ARIO.testnet().faucet.captchaUrl()` - returns the captcha URL for the testnet faucet. Open this URL in a new browser window and listen for the `ario-jwt-success` event to be emitted. - `ARIO.testnet().faucet.claimWithAuthToken({ authToken, recipient, quantity })` - claims tokens for the specified recipient address using the provided auth token. - `ARIO.testnet().faucet.verifyAuthToken({ authToken })` - verifies if the provided auth token is still valid. Example client-side code for claiming tokens ```typescript const testnet = ARIO.testnet(); const captchaUrl = await ario.faucet.captchaUrl(); // open the captcha URL in the browser, and listen for the auth token event const captchaWindow = window.open( captchaUrl.captchaUrl, '_blank', 'width=600,height=600', ); /** * The captcha URL includes a window.parent.postMessage event that is used to send the auth token to the parent window. * You can store the auth token in localStorage and use it to claim tokens for the duration of the auth token's expiration (default 1 hour). */ window.parent.addEventListener('message', async (event) => { if (event.data.type === 'ario-jwt-success') { localStorage.setItem('ario-jwt', event.data.token); localStorage.setItem('ario-jwt-expires-at', event.data.expiresAt); // close our captcha window captchaWindow?.close(); // claim the tokens using the JWT token const res = await testnet.faucet .claimWithAuthToken({ authToken: event.data.token, recipient: await window.arweaveWallet.getActiveAddress(), quantity: new ARIOToken(100).toMARIO().valueOf(), // 100 ARIO }) .then((res) => { alert( 'Successfully claimed 100 ARIO tokens! Transaction ID: ' + res.id, ); }) .catch((err) => { alert(`Failed to claim tokens: ${err}`); }); } }); /** * Once you have a valid JWT, you can check if it is still valid and use it for subsequent requests without having to open the captcha again. */ if ( localStorage.getItem('ario-jwt-expires-at') && Date.now() # Primary Names (/(ario-contract)/primary-names) #### getPrimaryNames() Retrieves all primary names paginated and sorted by the specified criteria. The `cursor` used for pagination is the last name from the previous request. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); const names = await ario.getPrimaryNames({ cursor: 'ao', // this is the last name from the previous request limit: 1, sortBy: 'startTimestamp', sortOrder: 'desc', }); ``` **Output:** ```json { \"sortOrder\": \"desc\", \"hasMore\": true, \"totalItems\": 100, \"limit\": 1, \"sortBy\": \"startTimestamp\", \"cursor\": \"arns\", \"items\": [ { \"owner\": \"HwFceQaMQnOBgKDpnFqCqgwKwEU5LBme1oXRuQOWSRA\", \"startTimestamp\": 1719356032297, \"name\": \"arns\" } ] } ``` #### getPrimaryName() Retrieves the primary name for a given name or address. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); const name = await ario.getPrimaryName({ name: 'arns', }); // or const name = await ario.getPrimaryName({ address: 't4Xr0_J4Iurt7caNST02cMotaz2FIbWQ4Kbj616RHl3', }); ``` **Output:** ```json { \"owner\": \"HwFceQaMQnOBgKDpnFqCqgwKwEU5LBme1oXRuQOWSRA\", \"startTimestamp\": 1719356032297, \"name\": \"arns\" } ``` #### setPrimaryName() Sets an ArNS name already owned by the `signer` as their primary name. Note: `signer` must be the owner of the `processId` that is assigned to the name. If not, the transaction will fail. _Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ARIO.init` to sign the transaction._ ```typescript const signer = new ArweaveSigner(jwk); const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ signer }); await ario.setPrimaryName({ name: 'my-arns-name' }); // the caller must already have purchased the name my-arns-name and be assigned as the owner of the processId that is assigned to the name ``` #### requestPrimaryName() Requests a primary name for the `signer`'s address. The request must be approved by the new owner of the requested name via the `approvePrimaryNameRequest`[#approveprimarynamerequest-name-address-] API. _Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ARIO.init` to sign the transaction._ ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk) }); const { id: txId } = await ario.requestPrimaryName({ name: 'arns', }); ``` #### getPrimaryNameRequest() Retrieves the primary name request for a a wallet address. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); const request = await ario.getPrimaryNameRequest({ initiator: 't4Xr0_J4Iurt7caNST02cMotaz2FIbWQ4Kbj616RHl3', }); ``` **Output:** ```json { \"initiator\": \"t4Xr0_J4Iurt7caNST02cMotaz2FIbWQ4Kbj616RHl3\", \"name\": \"arns\", \"startTimestamp\": 1728067635857, \"endTimestamp\": 1735843635857 } ``` # Vaults (/(ario-contract)/vaults) #### getVault() Retrieves the locked-balance user vault of the ARIO process by the specified wallet address and vault ID. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); const vault = await ario.getVault({ address: 'QGWqtJdLLgm2ehFWiiPzMaoFLD50CnGuzZIPEdoDRGQ', vaultId: 'vaultIdOne', }); ``` **Output:** ```json { \"balance\": 1000000, \"startTimestamp\": 123, \"endTimestamp\": 4567 } ``` #### getVaults() Retrieves all locked-balance user vaults of the ARIO process, paginated and sorted by the specified criteria. The `cursor` used for pagination is the last wallet address from the previous request. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); const vaults = await ario.getVaults({ cursor: '0', limit: 100, sortBy: 'balance', sortOrder: 'desc', }); ``` **Output:** ```json { \"items\": [ { \"address\": \"QGWqtJdLLgm2ehFWiiPzMaoFLD50CnGuzZIPEdoDRGQ\", \"vaultId\": \"vaultIdOne\", \"balance\": 1000000, \"startTimestamp\": 123, \"endTimestamp\": 4567 }, { \"address\": \"QGWqtJdLLgm2ehFWiiPzMaoFLD50CnGuzZIPEdoDRGQ\", \"vaultId\": \"vaultIdTwo\", \"balance\": 1000000, \"startTimestamp\": 123, \"endTimestamp\": 4567 } // ...98 other addresses with vaults ], \"hasMore\": true, \"nextCursor\": \"QGWqtJdLLgm2ehFWiiPzMaoFLD50CnGuzZIPEdoDRGQ\", \"totalItems\": 1789, \"sortBy\": \"balance\", \"sortOrder\": \"desc\" } ``` #### vaultedTransfer() Transfers `mARIO` to the designated `recipient` address and locks the balance for the specified `lockLengthMs` milliseconds. The `revokable` flag determines if the vaulted transfer can be revoked by the sender. _Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ARIO.init` to sign the transaction._ ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk) }); const { id: txId } = await ario.vaultedTransfer( { recipient: '-5dV7nk7waR8v4STuwPnTck1zFVkQqJh5K9q9Zik4Y5', quantity: new ARIOToken(1000).toMARIO(), lockLengthMs: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365, // 1 year revokable: true, }, // optional additional tags { tags: [{ name: 'App-Name', value: 'My-Awesome-App' }] }, ); ``` #### revokeVault() Revokes a vaulted transfer by the recipient address and vault ID. Only the sender of the vaulted transfer can revoke it. _Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ARIO.init` to sign the transaction._ ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk) }); const { id: txId } = await ario.revokeVault({ recipient: '-5dV7nk7waR8v4STuwPnTck1zFVkQqJh5K9q9Zik4Y5', vaultId: 'IPdwa3Mb_9pDD8c2IaJx6aad51Ss-_TfStVwBuhtXMs', }); ``` #### createVault() Creates a vault for the specified `quantity` of mARIO from the signer's balance and locks it for the specified `lockLengthMs` milliseconds. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk) }); const { id: txId } = await ario.createVault({ lockLengthMs: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365, // 1 year quantity: new ARIOToken(1000).toMARIO(), }); ``` #### extendVault() Extends the lock length of a signer's vault by the specified `extendLengthMs` milliseconds. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk) }); const { id: txId } = await ario.extendVault({ vaultId: 'vaultIdOne', extendLengthMs: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365, // 1 year }); ``` #### increaseVault() Increases the balance of a signer's vault by the specified `quantity` of mARIO. ```typescript const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk) }); const { id: txId } = await ario.increaseVault({ vaultId: 'vaultIdOne', quantity: new ARIOToken(1000).toMARIO(), }); ``` # AR.IO SDK (/index) **For AI and LLM users**: Access the complete AR.IO SDK documentation in plain text format at llm.txt for easy consumption by AI agents and language models. # AR.IO SDK Please refer to the [source code](https://github.com/ar-io/ar-io-sdk) for SDK details. # Logging (/logging) The library uses a lightweight console logger by default for both Node.js and web environments. The logger outputs structured JSON logs with timestamps. You can configure the log level via `setLogLevel()` API or provide a custom logger that satisfies the `ILogger` interface. #### Default Logger ```typescript // set the log level Logger.default.setLogLevel('debug'); // Create a new logger instance with a specific level const logger = new Logger({ level: 'debug' }); ``` #### Custom Logger Implementation You can provide any custom logger that implements the `ILogger` interface: ```typescript // Custom logger example const customLogger: ILogger = { info: (message, ...args) => console.log(`[INFO] ${message}`, ...args), warn: (message, ...args) => console.warn(`[WARN] ${message}`, ...args), error: (message, ...args) => console.error(`[ERROR] ${message}`, ...args), debug: (message, ...args) => console.debug(`[DEBUG] ${message}`, ...args), setLogLevel: (level) => { /* implement level filtering */ }, }; // Use custom logger with any class const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ logger: customLogger }); // or set it as the default logger in the entire SDK Logger.default = customLogger; ``` #### Winston Logger (Optional) For advanced logging features, you can optionally install Winston and use the provided Winston logger adapter: ```bash yarn add winston ``` ```typescript // Create Winston logger with custom configuration const winstonLogger = new WinstonLogger({ level: 'debug', }); // Use with any class that accepts a logger const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ logger: winstonLogger }); // or set it as the default logger in the entire SDK Logger.default = winstonLogger; ``` #### Other Popular Loggers You can easily integrate other popular logging libraries: ```typescript // Bunyan example const bunyanLogger = bunyan.createLogger({ name: 'ar-io-sdk' }); const adapter: ILogger = { info: (message, ...args) => bunyanLogger.info({ args }, message), warn: (message, ...args) => bunyanLogger.warn({ args }, message), error: (message, ...args) => bunyanLogger.error({ args }, message), debug: (message, ...args) => bunyanLogger.debug({ args }, message), setLogLevel: (level) => bunyanLogger.level(level), }; const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ logger: adapter }); // or set it as the default logger in the entire SDK Logger.default = adapter; ``` # Pagination (/pagination) #### Overview Certain APIs that could return a large amount of data are paginated using cursors. The SDK uses the `cursor` pattern (as opposed to pages) to better protect against changing data while paginating through a list of items. For more information on pagination strategies refer to [this article](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/api-pagination-best-practices#api-pagination-techniques-). Paginated results include the following properties: - `items`: the list of items on the current request, defaulted to 100 items. - `nextCursor`: the cursor to use for the next batch of items. This is `undefined` if there are no more items to fetch. - `hasMore`: a boolean indicating if there are more items to fetch. This is `false` if there are no more items to fetch. - `totalItems`: the total number of items available. This may change as new items are added to the list, only use this for informational purposes. - `sortBy`: the field used to sort the items, by default this is `startTimestamp`. - `sortOrder`: the order used to sort the items, by default this is `desc`. To request all the items in a list, you can iterate through the list using the `nextCursor` until `hasMore` is `false`. ```typescript let hasMore = true; let cursor: string | undefined; const gateaways = []; while (hasMore) { const page = await ario.getGateways({ limit: 100, cursor }); gateaways.push(...items); cursor = page.nextCursor; hasMore = page.hasMore; } ``` #### Filtering Paginated APIs also support filtering by providing a `filters` parameter. Filters can be applied to any field in the response. When multiple keys are provided, they are treated as AND conditions (all conditions must match). When multiple values are provided for a single key (as an array), they are treated as OR conditions (any value can match). Example: ```typescript const records = await ario.getArNSRecords({ filters: { type: 'lease', processId: [ 'ZkgLfyHALs5koxzojpcsEFAKA8fbpzP7l-tbM7wmQNM', 'r61rbOjyXx3u644nGl9bkwLWlWmArMEzQgxBo2R-Vu0', ], }, }); ``` In the example above, the query will return ArNS records where: - The type is \"lease\" AND - The processId is EITHER \"ZkgLfyHALs5koxzojpcsEFAKA8fbpzP7l-tbM7wmQNM\" OR \"r61rbOjyXx3u644nGl9bkwLWlWmArMEzQgxBo2R-Vu0\" # Token Conversion (/token-conversion) The ARIO process stores all values as mARIO (milli-ARIO) to avoid floating-point arithmetic issues. The SDK provides an `ARIOToken` and `mARIOToken` classes to handle the conversion between ARIO and mARIO, along with rounding logic for precision. **All process interactions expect values in mARIO. If numbers are provided as inputs, they are assumed to be in raw mARIO values.** #### Converting ARIO to mARIO ```typescript const arioValue = 1; const mARIOValue = new ARIOToken(arioValue).toMARIO(); const mARIOValue = 1_000_000; const arioValue = new mARIOToken(mARIOValue).toARIO(); ```","estimatedWords":9594,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:09:47.405Z","breadcrumbs":["sdks","ar io sdk","llm.txt"],"siteKey":"ario","siteName":"AR-IO Network","depth":3,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:09:47.405Z"},{"url":"https://docs.ar.io/sdks/ar-io-sdk/general","title":"General","content":"AR.IO SDKARIO ContractGeneralCopy MarkdownOpeninit() Factory function to that creates a read-only or writeable client.

This is useful when you need fine-grained control over the configuration: > _Wayfinder client that caches the top 10 gateways by operator stake from the ARIO Network for 1 hour and uses the fastest pinging routing strategy to select the fastest gateway for requests._ ```javascript const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({ // cache the top 10 gateways by operator stake from the ARIO Network for 1 hour gatewaysProvider: new SimpleCacheGatewaysProvider({ ttlSeconds: 60 * 60, // cache the gateways for 1 hour gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({ ario: ARIO.mainnet(), sortBy: 'operatorStake', sortOrder: 'desc', limit: 10, }), }), // routing settings routingSettings: { // use the fastest pinging strategy to select the fastest gateway for requests strategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 1000, }), // events events: { onRoutingStarted: (event) => { console.log('Routing started!', event); }, onRoutingSkipped: (event) => { console.log('Routing skipped!', event); }, onRoutingSucceeded: (event) => { console.log('Routing succeeded!', event); }, }, }, // verification settings verificationSettings: { // enable verification - if false, verification will be skipped for all requests enabled: true, // verify the data using the hash of the data against a list of trusted gateways strategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({ trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'], }), // strict verification - if true, verification failures will cause requests to fail strict: true, // events events: { onVerificationProgress: (event) => { console.log('Verification progress!', event); }, onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => { console.log('Verification succeeded!', event); }, onVerificationFailed: (event) => { console.log('Verification failed!', event); }, }, }, }); ``` # NetworkGatewaysProvider (/wayfinder-core/(gateway-providers)/networkgatewaysprovider) Returns a list of gateways from the ARIO Network based on on-chain metrics. You can specify on-chain metrics for gateways to prioritize the highest quality gateways. This requires installing the `@ar.io/sdk` package and importing the `ARIO` object. *It is recommended to use this provider for most use cases to leverage the AR.IO Network.* ```javascript // requests will be routed to one of the top 10 gateways by operator stake const gatewayProvider = new NetworkGatewaysProvider({ ario: ARIO.mainnet(), sortBy: 'operatorStake', // sort by 'operatorStake' | 'totalDelegatedStake' sortOrder: 'desc', // 'asc' limit: 10, // number of gateways to use filter: (gateway) => { // use only active gateways that did not fail in the last epoch return gateway.status === 'joined' && gateway.stats.failedConsecutiveEpochs === 0; }, }); ``` # StaticGatewaysProvider (/wayfinder-core/(gateway-providers)/staticgatewaysprovider) The static gateway provider returns a list of gateways that you provide. This is useful for testing or for users who want to use a specific gateway for all requests. ```javascript const gatewayProvider = new StaticGatewaysProvider({ gateways: ['https://arweave.net'], }); ``` # TrustedPeersGatewaysProvider (/wayfinder-core/(gateway-providers)/trustedpeersgatewaysprovider) Fetches a dynamic list of trusted peer gateways from an AR.IO gateway's `/ar-io/peers` endpoint. This provider is useful for discovering available gateways from a trusted source. ```javascript const gatewayProvider = new TrustedPeersGatewaysProvider({ trustedGateway: 'https://arweave.net', // Gateway to fetch peers from }); // The provider will fetch the peer list from https://arweave.net/ar-io/peers // and return an array of gateway URLs from the response ``` # Caching (/wayfinder-core/(installation-notes)/caching) Wayfinder supports intelligent caching: - **In browsers**: Uses localStorage for persistent caching across page reloads - **In Node.js**: Uses in-memory caching - **What's cached**: Gateway lists, routing decisions, and more - **Cache configuration**: - `cache: true` - Enable with default 5-minute TTL - `cache: { ttlSeconds: 3600 }` - Enable with custom TTL (in seconds) - `cache: false` - Disable caching (default) # Optional Dependencies (/wayfinder-core/(installation-notes)/optional-dependencies) The `@ar.io/sdk` package is an optional peer dependency. To use AR.IO network gateways, you must explicitly provide an `ario` instance: **With AR.IO SDK (Recommended):** ```bash npm install @ar.io/wayfinder-core @ar.io/sdk yarn add @ar.io/wayfinder-core @ar.io/sdk ``` - `createWayfinderClient({ ario: ARIO.mainnet() })` uses AR.IO network gateways - Supports intelligent gateway selection criteria - Dynamic gateway discovery and updates # Global request events (/wayfinder-core/(monitoring-and-events)/global-request-events) Wayfinder emits events during the routing and verification process for all requests, allowing you to monitor its operation. All events are emitted on the `wayfinder.emitter` event emitter, and are updated for each request. ```javascript // Provide events to the Wayfinder constructor for tracking all requests const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({ routingSettings: { events: { onRoutingStarted: (event) => { console.log('Routing started!', event); }, onRoutingSkipped: (event) => { console.log('Routing skipped!', event); }, onRoutingSucceeded: (event) => { console.log('Routing succeeded!', event); }, }, }, verificationSettings: { events: { onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => { console.log(`Verification passed for transaction: ${event.txId}`); }, onVerificationFailed: (event) => { console.error( `Verification failed for transaction: ${event.txId}`, event.error, ); }, onVerificationProgress: (event) => { const percentage = (event.processedBytes / event.totalBytes) * 100; console.log( `Verification progress for ${event.txId}: ${percentage.toFixed(2)}%`, ); }, }, }, }); // listen to the global wayfinder event emitter for all requests wayfinder.emitter.on('routing-succeeded', (event) => { console.log(`Request routed to: ${event.targetGateway}`); }); wayfinder.emitter.on('routing-failed', (event) => { console.error(`Routing failed: ${event.error.message}`); }); wayfinder.emitter.on('verification-progress', (event) => { console.log(`Verification progress: ${event.progress}%`); }); wayfinder.emitter.on('verification-succeeded', (event) => { console.log(`Verification succeeded: ${event.txId}`); }); wayfinder.emitter.on('verification-failed', (event) => { console.error(`Verification failed: ${event.error.message}`); }); ``` # Request-specific events (/wayfinder-core/(monitoring-and-events)/request-specific-events) You can also provide events to the `request` function to track a single request. These events are called for each request and are not updated for subsequent requests. Events are still emitted to the global event emitter for all requests. It is recommended to use the global event emitter for tracking all requests, and the request-specific events for tracking a single request. ```javascript // create a wayfinder instance with verification enabled const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({ verificationSettings: { enabled: true, strategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({ trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'], }), events: { onVerificationProgress: (event) => { console.log(`Global callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`); }, onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => { console.log(`Global callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`); }, }, }, }); const response = await wayfinder.request('ar://example-name', { verificationSettings: { // these callbacks will be triggered for this request only, the global callback handlers are still called events: { onVerificationProgress: (event) => { console.log(`Request-specific callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`); }, onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => { console.log(`Request-specific callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`); }, }, }, }); ``` # CompositeRoutingStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/compositeroutingstrategy) Chains multiple routing strategies together, trying each sequentially until one succeeds. This strategy provides maximum resilience by allowing complex fallback scenarios where you can combine different routing approaches. ```javascript import { CompositeRoutingStrategy, FastestPingRoutingStrategy, RandomRoutingStrategy, StaticRoutingStrategy, NetworkGatewaysProvider } from '@ar.io/wayfinder-core'; // Example 1: Try fastest ping first, fallback to random selection const strategy = new CompositeRoutingStrategy({ strategies: [ new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 500, gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({ ario: ARIO.mainnet(), sortBy: 'operatorStake', limit: 10, }), }), new RandomRoutingStrategy(), // fallback if ping strategy fails ], }); // Example 2: Try preferred gateway, then fastest ping, then any random gateway const complexStrategy = new CompositeRoutingStrategy({ strategies: [ new StaticRoutingStrategy({ gateway: 'https://my-preferred-gateway.com' }), new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 1000 }), new RandomRoutingStrategy(), // final fallback ], }); const gateway = await strategy.selectGateway({ gateways: [new URL('https://gateway1.com'), new URL('https://gateway2.com')], }); ``` **How it works:** 1. The composite strategy tries each routing strategy in order 2. If a strategy successfully returns a gateway, that gateway is used 3. If a strategy throws an error, the next strategy is tried 4. If all strategies fail, an error is thrown 5. The first successful strategy short-circuits the process (remaining strategies are not tried) **Common Use Cases:** - **Performance + Resilience**: Try fastest ping first, fallback to random if ping fails - **Preferred + Network**: Use your own gateway first, fallback to AR.IO network selection - **Multi-tier Fallback**: Try premium gateways, then standard gateways, then any available gateway - **Development + Production**: Use local gateway in development, fallback to production gateways # FastestPingRoutingStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/fastestpingroutingstrategy) Selects the fastest gateway based on simple HEAD request to the specified route. ```javascript // use with static gateways (override gatewaysProvider if provided) const routingStrategy = new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 1000, }); const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway({ gateways: [new URL('https://slow.net'), new URL('https://medium.net'), new URL('https://fast.net')], }); // use with gatewaysProvider (fetches dynamically) const routingStrategy2 = new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 1000, gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({ ario: ARIO.mainnet(), sortBy: 'operatorStake', limit: 20, }), }); const gateway2 = await routingStrategy2.selectGateway({ path: '/ar-io/info' }); // uses gatewaysProvider // override the gatewaysProvider with a static list of gateways const gateway3 = await routingStrategy2.selectGateway({ gateways: [new URL('https://priority-gateway.net')], // overrides gatewaysProvider path: '/ar-io/info' }); ``` # PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/preferredwithfallbackroutingstrategy) Uses a preferred gateway, with a fallback strategy if the preferred gateway is not available. This is useful for builders who run their own gateways and want to use their own gateway as the preferred gateway, but also want to have a fallback strategy in case their gateway is not available. This strategy is built using `CompositeRoutingStrategy` internally. It first attempts to ping the preferred gateway (using `PingRoutingStrategy` with `StaticRoutingStrategy`), and if that fails, it falls back to the specified fallback strategy. ```javascript const routingStrategy = new PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy({ preferredGateway: 'https://permagate.io', fallbackStrategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 500, }), }); ``` # RandomRoutingStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/randomroutingstrategy) Selects a random gateway from a list of gateways. ```javascript // Option 1: Use with static gateways (override gatewaysProvider if provided) const routingStrategy = new RandomRoutingStrategy(); const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway({ gateways: [new URL('https://arweave.net'), new URL('https://permagate.io')], }); // Option 2: Use with gatewaysProvider (fetches dynamically) const routingStrategy2 = new RandomRoutingStrategy({ gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({ ario: ARIO.mainnet(), sortBy: 'operatorStake', limit: 10, }), }); const gateway2 = await routingStrategy2.selectGateway(); // uses gatewaysProvider // Option 3: Override gatewaysProvider with static gateways const gateway3 = await routingStrategy2.selectGateway({ gateways: [new URL('https://custom-gateway.net')], // overrides gatewaysProvider }); ``` # RoundRobinRoutingStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/roundrobinroutingstrategy) Selects gateways in round-robin order. The gateway list is stored in memory and is not persisted across instances. You must provide either `gateways` OR `gatewaysProvider` (not both). ```javascript // use with a static list of gateways const routingStrategy = new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({ gateways: [new URL('https://arweave.net'), new URL('https://permagate.io')], }); // use with gatewaysProvider (loaded once and memoized) const routingStrategy2 = new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({ gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({ ario: ARIO.mainnet(), sortBy: 'operatorStake', sortOrder: 'desc', limit: 10, }), }); const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway(); // returns the next gateway in round-robin order ``` # StaticRoutingStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/staticroutingstrategy) ```javascript const routingStrategy = new StaticRoutingStrategy({ gateway: 'https://arweave.net', }); const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway(); // always returns the same gateway ``` # Strategy Composition Examples (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/strategy-composition-examples) Here are a few “lego-style” examples showing how existing routing strategies can be composed to suit different use cases. Each strategy implements `RoutingStrategy`, so they can be wrapped and combined freely. #### Random + Ping health checks Pick a random gateway, then verify it responds with a `HEAD` request before returning it. ```ts import { RandomRoutingStrategy, PingRoutingStrategy, } from \"@ar.io/wayfinder-core\"; const strategy = new PingRoutingStrategy({ routingStrategy: new RandomRoutingStrategy(), retries: 2, timeoutMs: 500, }); ``` #### Fastest ping wrapped with a simple cache Find the lowest-latency gateway and cache the result for five minutes to avoid constant pings. ```ts import { FastestPingRoutingStrategy, SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy, } from \"@ar.io/wayfinder-core\"; const strategy = new SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy({ routingStrategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 500 }), ttlSeconds: 300, }); ``` #### Preferred gateway + network fallback strategy Attempt to use a favorite gateway, but fallback to a fastest pinging strategy using the ARIO Network if it fails. ```ts import { PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy, RandomRoutingStrategy, PingRoutingStrategy, NetworkGatewaysProvider, } from \"@ar.io/wayfinder-core\"; // these will be our fallback gateways const gatewayProvider = new NetworkGatewaysProvider({ ario: ARIO.mainnet(), sortBy: 'operatorStake', limit: 5, }); // this is our fallback strategy if our preferred gateway fails const fastestPingStrategy = new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 500, gatewaysProvider: gatewayProvider, }); // compose the strategies together, the preferred gateway will be used first, and if it fails, the fallback strategy will be used. const strategy = new PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy({ preferredGateway: \"https://my-gateway.example\", fallbackStrategy: fastestPingStrategy, }); ``` #### Round-robin + ping verification Cycle through gateways sequentially, checking each one’s health before use. ```ts import { RoundRobinRoutingStrategy, PingRoutingStrategy, NetworkGatewaysProvider, } from \"@ar.io/wayfinder-core\"; // use static gateways const strategy = new PingRoutingStrategy({ routingStrategy: new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({ gateways: [new URL(\"https://gw1\"), new URL(\"https://gw2\")], }), }); // use a dynamic list of gateways from the ARIO Network const strategy2 = new PingRoutingStrategy({ routingStrategy: new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({ gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({ ario: ARIO.mainnet(), sortBy: 'operatorStake', limit: 5, }), }), }); ``` #### Cache around any composed strategy Because `SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy` accepts any `RoutingStrategy`, you can cache more complex compositions too. ```ts import { RandomRoutingStrategy, PingRoutingStrategy, SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy, NetworkGatewaysProvider, } from \"@ar.io/wayfinder-core\"; // use a dynamic list of gateways from the ARIO Network const randomStrategy = new RandomRoutingStrategy({ gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({ ario: ARIO.mainnet(), sortBy: 'operatorStake', limit: 20, }), }); // wrap the random strategy with a ping strategy const pingRandom = new PingRoutingStrategy({ routingStrategy: randomStrategy, }); // wrap the ping random strategy with a cache strategy, caching the selected gateway for 10 minutes const cachedStrategy = new SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy({ routingStrategy: pingRandom, ttlSeconds: 600, }); ``` #### Complex multi-strategy fallback with CompositeRoutingStrategy Chain multiple strategies together for maximum resilience - try fastest ping first, then fall back to random selection if ping fails. ```ts import { CompositeRoutingStrategy, FastestPingRoutingStrategy, RandomRoutingStrategy, NetworkGatewaysProvider, } from \"@ar.io/wayfinder-core\"; // Define gateway provider for both strategies const gatewayProvider = new NetworkGatewaysProvider({ ario: ARIO.mainnet(), sortBy: 'operatorStake', limit: 15, }); // Create a composite strategy that tries fastest ping first, then random const strategy = new CompositeRoutingStrategy({ strategies: [ // Try fastest ping first (high performance, but may fail if all gateways are slow) new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 500, gatewaysProvider: gatewayProvider, }), // Fallback to random selection (guaranteed to work if gateways exist) new RandomRoutingStrategy({ gatewaysProvider: gatewayProvider, }), ], }); ``` In all cases, you can supply the composed strategy to `Wayfinder` (or whatever router factory you use) and pass in a gateways provider: ```ts const router = new Wayfinder({ gatewaysProvider: new StaticGatewaysProvider({ gateways: [new URL(\"https://gw1\"), new URL(\"https://gw2\")], }), routingStrategy: strategy, // any of the compositions above }); ``` # DataRootVerificationStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(verification-strategies)/datarootverificationstrategy) Verifies data integrity using Arweave by computing the data root for the transaction. This is useful for L1 transactions and is recommended for users who want to ensure the integrity of their data. ```javascript const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({ verificationSettings: { enabled: true, strategy: new DataRootVerificationStrategy({ trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'], }), }, }); ``` # HashVerificationStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(verification-strategies)/hashverificationstrategy) Verifies data integrity using SHA-256 hash comparison. This is the default verification strategy and is recommended for most users looking for a balance between security and performance. ```javascript const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({ verificationSettings: { enabled: true, strategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({ trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'], }), }, }); ``` # RemoteVerificationStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(verification-strategies)/remoteverificationstrategy) This strategy is used to verify data by checking the `x-ar-io-verified` header from the gateway that returned the data. If the header is set to `true`, the data is considered verified and trusted. This strategy is only recommended for users fetching data from their own gateways and want to avoid the overhead of the other verification strategies. ```javascript const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({ verificationSettings: { // no trusted gateways are required for this strategy enabled: true, strategy: new RemoteVerificationStrategy(), }, }); ``` # SignatureVerificationStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(verification-strategies)/signatureverificationstrategy) Verifies signatures of Arweave transactions and data items. Headers are retrieved from trusted gateways for use during verification. For a transaction, its data root is computed while streaming its data and then utilized alongside its headers for verification. For data items, the ANS-104 deep hash method of signature verification is used. ```javascript const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({ verificationSettings: { enabled: true, strategy: new SignatureVerificationStrategy({ trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'], }), }, }); ``` # Dynamic Routing (/wayfinder-core/dynamic-routing) Wayfinder supports a `resolveUrl` method which generates dynamic redirect URLs to a target gateway based on the provided routing strategy. This function can be used to directly replace any hard-coded gateway URLs, and instead use Wayfinder's routing logic to select a gateway for the request. #### ArNS names Given an ArNS name, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy. ```javascript const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({ arnsName: 'ardrive', }); // results in https://ardrive.\\ ``` #### Transaction Ids Given a txId, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy. ```javascript const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({ txId: 'example-tx-id', }); // results in https://\\/example-tx-id ``` #### Legacy arweave.net or arweave.dev URLs Given a legacy arweave.net or arweave.dev URL, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy. ```javascript const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({ originalUrl: 'https://arweave.net/example-tx-id', }); // results in https://\\/example-tx-id ``` #### ar:// URLs Given an ar:// URL, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy. ```javascript const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({ originalUrl: 'ar://example-name/subpath?query=value', }); // results in https://\\/example-name/subpath?query=value ``` # Wayfinder Core (/wayfinder-core) **For AI and LLM users**: Access the complete Wayfinder Core documentation in plain text format at llm.txt for easy consumption by AI agents and language models. # Wayfinder Core Please refer to the [source code](https://github.com/ar-io/wayfinder/tree/main/packages/wayfinder-core) for SDK details. # Request Flow (/wayfinder-core/request-flow) The following sequence diagram illustrates how Wayfinder processes requests: ```mermaid sequenceDiagram participant Client participant Wayfinder participant Gateways Provider participant Routing Strategy participant Selected Gateway participant Verification Strategy participant Trusted Gateways Client->>Wayfinder: request('ar://example') activate Wayfinder Wayfinder->>+Gateways Provider: getGateways() Gateways Provider-->>-Wayfinder: List of gateway URLs Wayfinder->>+Routing Strategy: selectGateway() from list of gateways Routing Strategy-->>-Wayfinder: Select gateway for request Wayfinder->>+Selected Gateway: Send HTTP request to target gateway Selected Gateway-->>-Wayfinder: Response with data & txId activate Verification Strategy Wayfinder->>+Verification Strategy: verifyData(responseData, txId) Verification Strategy->>Wayfinder: Emit 'verification-progress' events Verification Strategy->>Trusted Gateways: Request verification headers Trusted Gateways-->>Verification Strategy: Return verification headers Verification Strategy->>Verification Strategy: Compare computed vs trusted data Verification Strategy-->>-Wayfinder: Return request data with verification result alt Verification passed Wayfinder->>Wayfinder: Emit 'verification-passed' event Wayfinder-->>Client: Return verified response else Verification failed Wayfinder->>Wayfinder: Emit 'verification-failed' event Wayfinder-->>Client: Throw verification error end deactivate Wayfinder ``` # Telemetry (/wayfinder-core/telemetry) Wayfinder can optionally emit OpenTelemetry spans for every request. **By default, telemetry is disabled**.

Due to Arweave's permanent, immutable and public nature traditional file system operations such as permissions, file/folder renaming and moving, and file updates cannot be done by simply updating the on-chain data model. ArFS works around this by implementing a privacy and encryption pattern and defining an append-only transaction data model using tags within Arweave Transaction headers. Key Features File Structure ArFS organizes files and folders using a hierarchical structure. Files are stored as individual transactions on the Arweave blockchain, while folders are metadata that reference these file transactions. Metadata Each file and folder has associated metadata, such as the name, type, size, and modification timestamp. ArFS leverages Arweave's tagging system to store this metadata in a standardized format, which allows for easy querying and organization. File Permissions ArFS supports public and private file permissions. Public files can be accessed by anyone on the network, while private files are encrypted using the owner's private key, ensuring only they can decrypt and access the content. File Versioning ArFS supports versioning of files, allowing users to store multiple versions of a file and access previous versions at any time. This is achieved by linking new file transactions to previous versions through the use of metadata tags. Data Deduplication To minimize storage redundancy and costs, ArFS employs data deduplication techniques. If a user tries to store a file that already exists on the network, the protocol will simply create a new reference to the existing file instead of storing a duplicate copy. Search and Discovery ArFS enables users to search and discover files based on their metadata, such as file names, types, and tags. This is made possible by indexing the metadata stored within the Arweave blockchain. Interoperability ArFS is designed to be interoperable with other decentralized applications and services built on the Arweave network. This allows for seamless integration and collaboration between different applications and users. Getting Started To start using ArFS, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the Arweave ecosystem, acquire AR tokens to cover storage costs, and choose a compatible client or library to interact with the ArFS protocol.

This allows users to create an Arweave wallet directly through popular wallet providers like MetaMask, providing seamless cross-chain wallet management. Generated private keys provide a fully functional Arweave wallet, equipped to perform all standard operations, including holding AR tokens and Turbo Credits, and uploading data to the Arweave network. How It Works EthAReum uses a deterministic key derivation process that combines: Ethereum/Solana wallet signature - Provides the cryptographic foundation User-generated password - Adds additional entropy and security Standardized derivation algorithm - Ensures reproducible results The protocol generates a unique Arweave wallet that is cryptographically linked to your Ethereum or Solana wallet but remains completely independent. Browser Compatibility Recommended Browser: For optimal performance, use Chrome when working with EthAReum and MetaMask. While EthAReum functions correctly in most browsers, there are ongoing efforts to resolve some edge case compatibility issues in other environments. Password Security The EthAReum protocol incorporates a user-generated password in the wallet derivation process. This password provides an extra layer of security by contributing additional entropy to the wallet's derivation and serves as a critical verification step for wallet access. Permanent Password: The password used during the derivation of private keys is permanent and cannot be changed or recovered by any administrator. ArDrive is a decentralized platform with no account administration. It is crucial to keep this password secure. Password Requirements Must be set during initial wallet creation Used for all subsequent logins Required for encrypting private uploads Cannot be recovered if forgotten Wallet Addresses The public address of the generated Arweave wallet is derived from its public key and will be different from the public address of the Ethereum or Solana wallet used to generate it. Viewing Your Address The exact steps to obtain your generated wallet's public address depend on the dApp interface: ArDrive: Click the user profile icon in the top right when logged in Other dApps: Check the wallet settings or profile section Key Management Keyfiles vs Seed Phrases The Arweave ecosystem primarily uses keyfiles rather than seed phrases for wallet access: Keyfile: JSON file containing a Json Web Key (JWK) that acts as private keys Seed Phrase: Supported but not universally implemented across all dApps Keyfile Security: Always treat your keyfile with the same care as you would private keys for an Ethereum wallet. Learn more about keyfiles in the Arweave Cookbook. Accessing Your Keys Both keyfile and seed phrase are available for download in most dApps: ArDrive: Click the user profile icon in the top right when logged in Other dApps: Check wallet settings or export options Security Considerations One-Way Control EthAReum generates Arweave wallet private keys using a signature from your Ethereum/Solana wallet, ensuring that control only extends in one direction: ✅ EthAReum can generate Arweave wallets from Ethereum/Solana signatures ❌ EthAReum cannot access your Ethereum/Solana wallet or assets ✅ Your Ethereum/Solana assets remain completely secure and independent Signature Security Beware of Malicious dApps: Some malicious dApps or websites may disguise high-risk authorization transactions as simple signature requests. Always ensure that you only provide signatures to reputable and trusted dApps like ArDrive.

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up ClickHouse with your AR.IO gateway, and importing Parquet files to bootstrap your ClickHouse database. What is Parquet? Apache Parquet is a columnar storage file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. Unlike row-based storage formats like SQLite, Parquet organizes data by column rather than by row, which provides several advantages for analytical workloads: Efficient compression: Similar data is stored together, leading to better compression ratios Columnar access: You can read only the columns you need, reducing I/O operations Predicate pushdown: Filter operations can be pushed down to the storage layer, improving query performance For more information about Parquet, see the Parquet documentation. Current Integration with AR.IO Gateways In the current AR.IO gateway implementation, Parquet and ClickHouse run alongside SQLite rather than replacing it. This parallel architecture allows each database to handle what it does best: SQLite continues to handle transaction writes and updates ClickHouse with Parquet files is optimized for fast query performance, especially with large datasets The gateway continues to operate with SQLite just as it always has, maintaining all of its normal functionality. Periodically, the gateway will export batches of data from SQLite to Parquet files, which are then imported into ClickHouse. This batch-oriented approach is much more efficient than attempting to synchronize the databases in real-time, as it leverages Parquet's strength in handling large, immutable data sets. Note that despite Parquet's efficient compression, gateways may not see significant disk space reduction in all cases. While bundled transaction data is exported to Parquet, L1 data remains in SQLite. Without substantial unbundling and indexing filters, minimal data gets exported to Parquet, limiting potential storage savings. With ClickHouse integration enabled, GraphQL queries are primarily routed to ClickHouse, leveraging its superior performance for large datasets. This significantly improves response times while maintaining SQLite's reliability for transaction processing. For more information about gateway architecture and data processing, see our Gateway Architecture documentation.

Gateway operators managing significant volumes of data will notice substantial performance gains when using this configuration. Storage Considerations While Parquet files offer more efficient compression for the data they contain, it's important to understand the storage impact: Bundled transaction data is exported to Parquet and removed from SQLite, potentially saving space L1 data remains in SQLite regardless of Parquet configuration Space savings are highly dependent on your unbundling filters - without substantial unbundling configurations, minimal data gets exported to Parquet The more data you unbundle and export to Parquet, the greater the potential storage efficiency For gateway operators, this means proper filter configuration is crucial to realize storage benefits. The primary advantage remains significantly improved query performance for large datasets, with potential space savings as a secondary benefit depending on your specific configuration. The following sections will guide you through setting up ClickHouse with your AR.IO gateway, exporting data from SQLite to Parquet, and importing Parquet files to bootstrap your ClickHouse database. NoteThe below instructions are designed to be used in a linux environment. Windows and MacOS users must modify the instructions to use the appropriate package manager/ command syntax for their platform.Unless otherwise specified, all commands should be run from the root directory of the gateway.

This allows gateways the ability to accept data items to be submitted to the Arweave blockweave. The bundler service can be easily run inside Docker in the same way that the gateway is. It utilizes a separate docker compose file for configuration and deployment, which also allows for the use of a separate file for environmental variables specific to the bundler service. Additionally, the separation allows operators to spin their bundler service up or down at any time without affecting their core gateway service. Despite the use of separate docker compose files, the bundler service shares a docker network with the AR.IO gateway, and so is able to directly interact with the gateway service and data. For more information on ANS-104 Bundles, see the ANS-104 Bundles page.

This ensures users receive authentic, uncorrupted data with cryptographic proof of integrity. The verification system is what makes AR.IO gateways trustworthy data providers for the permaweb. How Gateways Verify Data Data verification is an ongoing process that uses Merkle tree cryptography to provide mathematical proof of data integrity. The process involves multiple specialized components working together to ensure cached data matches what's stored on Arweave: The Verification Workflow: Gateways achieve verification through a systematic five-phase process orchestrated by the DataVerificationWorker. This process ensures that every piece of cached data cryptographically matches its original form on Arweave, providing mathematical proof of integrity before serving data to users. 1. Discovery Phase Periodically scan for unverified data items Priority-based queue management (higher priority items first) Track retry attempts for failed verifications 2. Data Retrieval Fetch data attributes from gateway storage Retrieve the complete data stream Gather metadata needed for verification 3. Cryptographic Computation Calculate Merkle data root from actual data stream Generate cryptographic proofs using the same algorithm as Arweave Create verifiable hash chains 4. Root Comparison Compare computed root against indexed root in database Verify data hasn't been corrupted or altered Validate chunk integrity against Merkle proofs 5. Action Based on Results Success: Mark data as verified with timestamp Failure: Trigger re-import from Arweave or unbundle from parent Error: Increment retry counter and requeue for later Verification Types AR.IO gateways handle different types of data verification based on the data's origin: Transaction Data Verification For individual Arweave transactions: Direct root validation against transaction data roots stored on-chain Complete data reconstruction from chunks to ensure availability Cryptographic proof that data matches what was originally stored Bundle Data Verification For ANS-104 data bundles (collections of data items): Bundle integrity checks to verify the container is valid Individual item verification within each bundle Recursive unbundling when verification fails to re-extract items Nested bundle support for bundles containing other bundles Chunk-Level Validation At the most granular level: Merkle proof validation for individual data chunks Sequential integrity ensuring chunks form complete data Parallel verification of multiple chunks for performance Why Verification Matters Cryptographic Trust Foundation Mathematical Proof: Merkle tree cryptography provides irrefutable proof of data integrity Independent Validation: Multiple gateways verify the same data independently Network Consensus: Distributed verification creates trust without central authority Data Integrity Guarantees Tamper Detection: Any alteration to data is immediately detectable Corruption Recovery: Automatic healing of corrupted data through re-import Permanent Storage Validation: Ensures Arweave's permanence promise is maintained Gateway Reliability Continuous Monitoring: Ongoing verification catches issues before users encounter them Self-Healing System: Automatic recovery mechanisms maintain data availability Transparent Operations: Verification status and timestamps provide audit trails Explore Gateway Systems Data RetrievalLearn how gateways fetch data from multiple sources with verificationGateway ArchitectureUnderstand the technical architecture behind verification systemsRun Your Own GatewaySet up a gateway with built-in verification capabilitiesGateway ConfigurationConfigure verification settings and optimization optionsHow is this guide?GoodBadData RetrievalHow AR.IO gateways retrieve and share data from multiple sources including trusted peers and Arweave nodesGateway RegistryThe AR.IO Network consists of AR.IO gateway nodes, which are identified by their registered Arweave wallet addresses and either their IP addresses or hostnames, as stored in the network","estimatedWords":537,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:10:19.404Z","breadcrumbs":["learn","gateways","data verification"],"siteKey":"ario","siteName":"AR-IO Network","depth":3,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:10:19.404Z"},{"url":"https://docs.ar.io/build/upload/encryption","title":"Encryption","content":"Upload DataEncryptionCopy MarkdownOpenArweave has no built-in encryption.

In the AR.IO ecosystem, \"staking\" refers to the process of locking a specified amount of ARIO tokens into a protocol-controlled vault. This act signifies an opportunity cost for the staker, acting both as a motivator and a public pledge to uphold the network's collective interests. Once staked, tokens remain locked until the staker initiates an 'unstake / withdraw' action or reaches the end of the vault’s lock period. It is important to note that the ARIO Token is non-inflationary, distinguishing the AR.IO Network's staking mechanism from yield-generation tools found in other protocols. Staking in this context is about eligibility for potential rewards rather than direct token yield. By staking tokens, gateway operators (and their delegates) demonstrate their commitment to the network, thereby gaining eligibility for protocol-driven rewards and access to the network’s shared resources. Gateway Staking A gateway operator must stake tokens to join their gateway to the network, which not only makes them eligible for protocol rewards but also promotes network reliability. This staking requirement reassures users and developers of the gateway's commitment to the network’s objectives, and gateways that adhere to or surpass network performance standards become eligible for these rewards. Gateway operators may increase their stake above the minimum, known as excess stake. A gateway’s total stake is impacted the following epoch once excess stake is added or removed. Delegated Staking To promote participation from a wider audience, the network allows anyone with available ARIO tokens to partake in delegated staking. Users can choose to take part in the risk and rewards of gateway operations by staking their tokens with an active gateway (or multiple gateways) through an act known as delegating. Delegators can select which gateways to stake with in gateways.ar.io - maximize their potential rewards based on operator performance, stakes, and weights How Delegated Staking Works Delegated staking allows you to participate in the AR.IO Network's reward system without running your own gateway. By staking your ARIO tokens on existing gateways, you can earn rewards while supporting network infrastructure. When you delegate stake to a gateway, you're essentially lending your tokens to increase that gateway's total stake. This increases the gateway's chances of being selected as an observer, which means more potential rewards for both the gateway operator and you as a delegator. Benefits Passive Income: Earn rewards without running infrastructure Network Participation: Support the AR.IO Network's growth Flexibility: Redelegate to different gateways as conditions change Low Barrier to Entry: No technical expertise required Transparent Rewards: Clear visibility into reward distribution Getting Started Get ARIO TokensYou'll need ARIO tokens to delegate. See our comprehensive guide on How to Get ARIO Tokens for detailed information about acquiring tokens through exchanges, swaps, and network participation.Choose a GatewayResearch gateways on the Gateway Portal to find one that matches your preferences for reward sharing and performance. Look for gateways with strong uptime, competitive reward sharing percentages, and reliable operation history.Delegate Your StakeUse the Gateway Portal to delegate your tokens. The process is straightforward and your tokens remain secure throughout.Monitor Your RewardsTrack your delegation performance and rewards through the portal's dashboard. Receive your share of the gateway's rewards based on the percentage set by the gateway operator. Important Considerations Gateway Performance: Your rewards depend on the gateway's performance and observer selection Reward Sharing: Gateway operators set the percentage of rewards shared with delegators Redelegation: You can move your stake between gateways as network conditions change Withdrawal Delays: There may be delays when withdrawing your delegated stake Stake Redelegation This feature enables existing stakers to reallocate their staked tokens between gateways, known as redelegation. Both delegated stakers and gateway operators with excess stake (stake above the minimum network-join requirement) can take advantage of this feature. Redelegation is intended to offer users flexibility and the ability to respond to changing network conditions. Redeeming Delegated Stake for ArNS Staked tokens generally have restricted liquidity to maintain a healthy degree of stability in the network. However, an exception to these restrictions allows delegated stakers to use their staked tokens for specific ArNS-related services. By leveraging their staking rewards, delegates can further engage with ArNS, strengthening the name system’s utilization and impact across the network. Expedited Withdrawal Fees Gateway operators and delegated stakers can shorten the standard withdrawal delay period after initiating a withdrawal (or being placed into an automatic withdrawal by protocol mechanisms); this action is subject to a dynamic fee. At any point during the delay, users can choose to expedite access to their pending withdrawal tokens by paying a fee to the protocol balance, calculated based on how much sooner they want to receive their funds. Once triggered, the tokens are returned immediately to the user’s wallet.

Any gateway operator that wishes to join the AR.IO Network must register their node in the AR.IO smart contract's Gateway Address Registry. Registration involves staking a minimum amount of ARIO tokens and providing additional metadata describing the gateway service offered. These nodes adhere to the AR.IO Network's protocols, creating a collaborative environment of gateway nodes that vary in scale and specialization. The network promotes a fundamental level of service quality and trust minimization among its participants. The gateways.ar.io portal displays all gateways currently in the network, showing their stakes, performance scores, and operational metrics Benefits of Joining the Network Being part of the network grants AR.IO gateways an array of advantages: Simplified advertising of services and discovery by end users via the Gateway Address Registry More rapid bootstrapping of key gateway operational data due to prioritized data request fulfillment among gateways joined to the network Sharing of data processing results Auditability and transparency through the use of AGPL-3 licenses, which mandate public disclosure of any software changes, thereby reinforcing the network's integrity and reliability Improved network reliability and performance through an incentive protocol, which uses a system of evaluations and rewards to encourage high-quality service from gateways Eligibility to accept delegated staking improving a gateway's discoverability and reward opportunities Eligibility to receive distributions from the protocol balance - Gateways that have joined the network are eligible to receive token distributions based on their performance and contributions to the network How the GAR Works After joining the network, the operator's gateway can be easily discovered by permaweb apps, its health can be observed, and it can participate in data sharing protocols. A gateway becomes eligible to participate in the network's incentive protocol in the epoch following the one they joined in. The GAR advertises the specific attributes of each gateway including its stake, delegates, settings and services. This enables permaweb apps and users to discover which gateways are currently available and meet their needs. Apps that read the GAR can sort and filter it using the gateway metadata, for example, ranking gateways with the highest stake, reward performance, or feature set at the top of the list. This allows users to prefer the higher staked, more rewarded gateways with certain capabilities over lower staked, less rewarded gateways. Token Incentives and Network Monitoring The AR.IO network uses a sophisticated incentive system to ensure gateway quality and reliability: Token Incentives: Learn more about how gateways earn rewards and participate in the network economy in the Token section Observer Protocol: The network employs an Observer system that monitors gateway performance and ensures quality of service. Learn more about the Observer & Incentive Protocol and how it maintains network integrity Recap The Gateway Registry is the foundation of the AR.IO network's decentralized infrastructure.

Using a pricing oracle to fix name prices relative to a stable currency is not viable due to the infancy of available solutions and reliance on external dependencies. To address these challenges, ArNS is self-contained and adaptive, with name prices reflecting network activity and market conditions over time. To achieve this, ArNS incorporates: A dynamic pricing model that adjusts fees using a \"Demand Factor\" based on ArNS purchase activity A Returned Name Premium (RNP) system that applies a timed, descending multiplier to registration prices for names that have recently expired or been returned to the protocol This approach ensures that name valuations adapt to market conditions within the constraints of an immutable, maintenance-free smart contract framework. You can view current live pricing at ArNS.app to see these formulas in action. Key Definitions Protocol Revenue: Accumulated ARIO tokens from name registrations, lease extensions, and under_name sales Period (P): The time unit for DF adjustments, equivalent to one (1) day, denoted in milliseconds n: The current period indicator Price: The cost for permabuy or lease of a name Under_names: Subdomain equivalents, denoted by an underscore \"_\" prefixing the base domain Dynamic Pricing Model ArNS employs an adaptive pricing model to balance market demand with pricing fairness for name registration within the network. This model integrates static and dynamic elements, adjusting prices based on name length and purchase options like leasing, permanent acquisition, and undername amounts. Core Pricing Components Base Registration Fee (BRF) The fundamental price for names, varying by character length, adjusted periodically. Genesis Registration Fee (GRF) The starting price for name registrations varies by character length. This is superseded by Base Registration Fees as the protocol evolves. Table: Genesis Registration Fees Name LengthFee (ARIO)11,000,0002200,000320,000410,00052,50061,50078008500940010350113001225013-51200 Demand Factor (DF) A global price multiplier, reflecting namespace demand, adjusted each period based on revenue trends. DF Mechanics: Intent: The Demand Factor adjusts based on protocol revenue comparison to the Revenue Moving Average (RMA) Increase DF: When recent revenue is higher than or equal to (but non-zero) the RMA, the DF increases by 5.0% Decrease DF: When recent revenue is less than the RMA or both are zero, the DF decreases by 1.5% Maximum DF Value: Unbounded Minimum DF Value: 0.5 Starting Demand Factor: 1 (initial value at network launch) Revenue Moving Average (RMA) The average of protocol revenue from the past seven (7) periods. Pricing Formulas Adjusted Registration Fee (ARF) ARF=BRF×DFARF = BRF × DF ARF=BRF×DF Annual Fee Annual Fee=ARF×20Annual ~Fee = ARF × 20% Annual Fee=ARF×20 Lease Pricing Lease Registration Price: Lease Price=ARF+(Annual Fee×Years)Lease ~Price = ARF + (Annual ~Fee × Years) Lease Price=ARF+(Annual Fee×Years) Lease Extension/Renewal Price: Lease Renewal Price=Annual Fee×Years(max5years)Lease ~Renewal ~Price = Annual ~Fee × Years (max 5 years) Lease Renewal Price=Annual Fee×Years(max5years) Grace period: Two (2) weeks Permanent Purchases Permabuy Price: Permabuy Price=ARF+(AnnualFee×20years)Permabuy ~Price = ARF + (Annual Fee × 20 years) Permabuy Price=ARF+(AnnualFee×20years) Lease to Permabuy Price: Same as above Under Name Fees Initial Allocation: 10 under_names are included with each name registration For Leases: Lease Under Name Fee=BRF×DF×0.1Lease ~Under ~Name ~Fee = BRF × DF × 0.1% Lease Under Name Fee=BRF×DF×0.1 For Permabuys: Permabuy Under Name Fee=BRF×DF×0.5Permabuy ~Under ~Name ~Fee = BRF × DF × 0.5% Permabuy Under Name Fee=BRF×DF×0.5 Primary Name Fee Set or change primary name: The fee is equal to the associated fee for a single under_name purchase of a 51-character name of equivalent purchase type to the new primary name, regardless of the new primary name's length. Step Pricing Mechanics Synchronizes BRF (Base Rate Factor) with ARF (Adjusted Rate Factor) after seven (7) consecutive periods at the minimum DF value Resets DF to 1 following a step pricing adjustment Returned Name Premiums (RNP) ArNS applies a Returned Name Premium (RNP) to names that re-enter the market after expiration or permanent return. This premium starts at a maximum value and decreases linearly over a predefined window, ensuring fair and transparent pricing for re-registered names. RNP Mechanics Intent The premium starts at its maximum and decreases linearly until the name is purchased. If the name is not purchased before the premium window closes, it reverts to standard pricing and is no longer classified as \"recently returned.\" RNP Window Duration: Fourteen (14) periods Returned Name Premium Formula The premium multiplier follows a linearly declining function: RNP=50−(49/14)×tRNP = 50 - (49 / 14) × t RNP=50−(49/14)×t Where: RNP: The Returned Name Premium multiplier applied to the purchased name price t: Amount of time (or time-intervals) elapsed since the start of the return window RNP Registration Price Price=RNP×(Lease Or Permabuy) Registration PricePrice = RNP × (Lease~Or~Permabuy) ~Registration~ Price Price=RNP×(Lease Or Permabuy) Registration Price Permanent Name Return Proceeds Split 50% goes to the returning name owner 50% goes to the protocol balance The RNP multiplier is applied to the registration price of both permanently purchased and leased names.

A leased name can have its lease extended or renewed but only up to a maximum active lease of five (5) years at any time. Permanent Registration (Permabuy) A name may be purchased for an indefinite duration with no expiration date. Registering a name requires spending ARIO tokens corresponding to the name's character length and purchase type. Name Registry The ArNS Registry is a list of all registered names and their associated ANT Process IDs. Key rules embedded within the smart contract include: Genesis Prices: Set within the contract as starting conditions Dynamic Pricing: Varies based on name length, purchase type (lease vs buy), lease duration, and current Demand Factor Name Records: Include a pointer to the Arweave Name Token process identifier, lease end time (if applicable), and undername allocation Reassignment: Name registrations can be reassigned from one ANT to another Lease Extension: Anyone with available ARIO Tokens can extend any name's active lease Lease to Permanent Buy: Anyone with available ARIO Tokens can convert a name's lease to a permanent buy Undername Capacity: Additional undername capacity can be purchased for any actively registered name Name Removal: Name records can only be removed from the registry if a lease expires, or a permanent name is returned to the protocol Name Validation Rules All names registered must meet the following criteria: Valid characters: Only numbers 0-9, characters a-z and dashes Dash placement: Dashes cannot be leading or trailing characters Single character domains: Dashes cannot be used in single character domains Length limits: 1 character minimum, 51 characters maximum Reserved names: Cannot be an invalid name predesignated to prevent unintentional use/abuse such as www Lease Management Lease Expirations When a lease term ends, there is a grace period of two (2) weeks where the lease can be renewed before it fully expires. If this grace period elapses, the name is considered expired and returns to the protocol for public registration. Once expired, a name's associated undername registrations and capacity also expire. A recently expired name's registration shall be priced subject to the \"Returned Name Premium\" mechanics. Lease to Permabuy Conversions An actively leased name may be converted to a permanent registration. The price for this conversion shall be treated as if it were a new permanent name purchase. This functionality allows users to transition from leasing to permanent ownership based on changing needs and available resources. It generates additional protocol revenue through conversion fees, contributing to the ecosystem's financial health and reward system. Permanent Name Return Users have the option to \"return\" their permanently registered names back to the protocol. This process allows users to relinquish their ownership, returning the name to the protocol for public re-registration. Only the Owner of a name can initiate a name return. When a permanent name is returned, the name is subject to a \"Returned Name Premium\", similar to expired leases. A key difference is that if the name is repurchased during the premium window, the proceeds are split between the returning owner and the protocol balance. Primary Names The Arweave Name System (ArNS) supports the designation of a \"Primary Name\" for users, simplifying how Arweave addresses are displayed across applications. A Primary Name is a user-friendly alias that replaces complex wallet addresses, making interactions and profiles easier to manage and identify. Users can set one of their owned ArNS names as their Primary Name, subject to a small fee. This allows applications to use a single, human-readable identifier for a wallet, improving user experience across the network.

Name Tokens are unique AO Computer based tokens/processes that give their owners the ability to update the Arweave Transaction IDs that their associated friendly names point to. What is an ANT? The ANT smart contract process is a standardized contract that implements the specific Arweave Name Process specification required by AR.IO gateways who resolve ArNS names and their Arweave Transaction IDs. It also contains other basic functionality to establish ownership and the ability to transfer ownership and update the Arweave Transaction ID. Name Tokens have an owner, who can transfer the token and control its modifiable settings. These settings include modifying the address resolution time to live (ttl) for each name contained in the ANT, and other settings like the ANT Name, Ticker, and an ANT Controller. Ownership and Control The controller can only manage the ANT and set and update records, name, and the ticker, but cannot transfer the ANT. Note that ANTs are initially created in accordance with network standards by an end user who then has the ability to transfer its ownership or assign a controller as they see fit. Owners of names should ensure their ANT supports evolve ability if future modifications are desired. Loss of a private key for a permanently purchased name can result in the name being \"bricked\". Under_name Ownership Undernames can have an owner set on them. This owner is empowered to set that undername as their primary name, can remove that undername as their primary name, and has full control over that Undername's metadata, such as: Transaction Id - the data the record resolves to. TTL Seconds - the Time To Live in seconds the data is cached for by clients. Owner - the owner of the record. Description - the description of the record. Display Name - the display name for the owner of the record. Keywords - the keywords for the record. Logo - the logo of the record. They do NOT have control over the priority of the undername, which is restricted to the ANT Controllers and Owner.

These undernames are assigned individually at the time of registration or can be added on to any registered name at any time. Undernames use an underscore \"\" in place of a more typically used dot \".\" to separate the subdomain from the main ArNS domain. Secondary Markets Secondary markets could be created by ecosystem partners that facilitate the trading of Name Tokens. Additionally, tertiary markets could be created that support the leasing of these friendly names to other users. Such markets, if any, would be created by third parties unrelated to and outside of the scope of this paper or control of the Foundation. Next Steps Ready to understand how pricing works?

This balance is primarily funded through ArNS name purchases, ensuring sustainable network incentives aligned with usage. Epoch Allocation Each epoch, a portion of the protocol balance is earmarked for distribution as rewards. This value shall begin at 0.1% per epoch for the first year of operation, then linearly decline down to and stabilize at 0.05% over the following 6 months. Funding Sources ArNS Name Purchases: Primary funding mechanism - fees from ArNS name registrations and renewals Network Genesis Allocation: Initial ARIO tokens allocated at network launch Undistributed Rewards: Rewards not claimed due to poor performance roll forward to future epochs From this allocation, two distinct reward categories are derived: Base Rewards Base Gateway Reward (BGR) This is the portion of the reward allocated to each Functional Gateway within the network and is calculated as: BGR=Epoch Reward Allocation×0.9Total Gateways in the NetworkBGR = \\frac{\\text{Epoch Reward Allocation} \\times 0.9}{\\text{Total Gateways in the Network}} BGR=Total Gateways in the NetworkEpoch Reward Allocation×0.9​ Base Observer Reward (BOR) Observers, due to their additional responsibilities, have a separate reward calculated as: BOR=Epoch Reward Allocation×0.1Total Selected Observers for the EpochBOR = \\frac{\\text{Epoch Reward Allocation} \\times 0.1}{\\text{Total Selected Observers for the Epoch}} BOR=Total Selected Observers for the EpochEpoch Reward Allocation×0.1​ Distribution Based on Performance The reward distribution is contingent on the performance classifications derived from the Performance Evaluation: Functional Gateways: Gateways that meet the performance criteria receive the Base Gateway Reward. Deficient Gateways: Gateways falling short in performance do not receive any gateway rewards. Functional Observers: Observers that fulfilled their duty receive the Base Observer Reward. Deficient Observers: Observers failing to meet their responsibilities do not receive observer rewards. Furthermore, if they are also Functional Gateways, their gateway reward is reduced by 25% for that epoch as a consequence for not performing their observation duty. Epoch reward distributions showing the relationship between eligible rewards (total available) and distributed rewards (actually paid out) across epochs. The difference represents rewards not distributed due to gateway or observer deficiencies. Auto-Staking Gateways shall be given the option to have their reward tokens \"auto-staked\" to their existing stake or sent to their wallet as unlocked tokens. The default setting shall be \"auto-staked\". Distribution to Delegates The protocol will automatically distribute a Functional Gateway's shared rewards with its delegates. The distribution will consider the gateway's total reward for the period (including observation rewards), the gateway's \"Delegate Reward Share Ratio\", and each delegate's stake proportional to the total delegation. Each individual delegate reward is calculated as: DRi=Total Rewards×Reward Share Ratio×Delegate’s StakeTotal Delegated StakeDR_i = \\text{Total Rewards} \\times \\text{Reward Share Ratio} \\times \\frac{\\text{Delegate's Stake}}{\\text{Total Delegated Stake}} DRi​=Total Rewards×Reward Share Ratio×Total Delegated StakeDelegate’s Stake​ Unlike gateways, token reward distributions to delegated stakers will only be \"auto-staked\" in that they will be automatically added to the delegate's existing stake associated with the rewarded gateway. The delegated staker is then free to withdraw their staked rewards at any time (subject to withdrawal delays). Undistributed Rewards In cases where rewards are not distributed, either due to the inactivity or deficiency of gateways or observers, the allocated tokens shall remain in the protocol balance and carry forward to the next epoch. This mechanism is in place to discourage observers from frivolously marking their peers as offline in hopes of attaining a higher portion of the reward pool. Note that if a gateway (and its delegates) leaves the network or a delegate fully withdraws stake from a gateway, they become ineligible to receive rewards within the corresponding epoch and the earmarked rewards will not be distributed. Handling Deficient Gateways To maintain network efficiency and reduce contract state bloat, gateways that are marked as deficient, and thus fail to receive rewards, for thirty (30) consecutive epochs will automatically trigger a \"Network Leave\" action and be subject to the associated stake withdrawal durations for both gateway stake and any delegated stake. In addition, the gateway shall have its minimum network-join stake slashed by 100%. The slashed stake shall be immediately sent to the protocol balance. Next Steps Congratulations!

The hashchain-based entropy provides cryptographic randomness for selecting: Observer Gateways: The 50 gateways chosen to perform observations Prescribed ArNS Names: The 2 common names all observers must evaluate This approach prevents manipulation while maintaining weighted probabilities based on gateway performance and commitment. gateways.ar.io/#/observers shows the current epoch prescribed observers and arns names, as well as their submission status Weighted Selection Criteria Observer selection is based on normalized composite weights that combine multiple performance and commitment factors. These weights determine each gateway's probability of being selected as an observer for the epoch. The selection considers four key factors that are multiplied together to create a composite weight (CW): Stake Weight (SW): Financial commitment to the network Tenure Weight (TW): Length of network participation Gateway Performance Ratio Weight (GPRW): Historical gateway performance Observer Performance Ratio Weight (OPRW): Historical observer performance These weights are then normalized across all eligible gateways to create selection probabilities. For detailed weight calculations and formulas, see Performance Evaluation. Hashchain Random Selection The selection process uses hashchain entropy from previous AR.IO contract state messages to achieve cryptographically secure randomness: How Hashchain Selection Works Entropy Source: Random numbers are generated from the hashchain of previous contract state messages Weighted Mapping: Each random number maps to normalized weight ranges of eligible gateways Observer Selection: The gateway whose weight range contains each random number is selected Prescribed Names: The same entropy selects 2 ArNS names that all observers must test This creates tamper-resistant selection where higher-weighted gateways have proportionally better chances of selection, while maintaining true randomness that cannot be predicted or manipulated. Chunk/Offset Sampling In addition to observer selection, the protocol includes a separate sampling process for chunk/offset validation: Gateway Selection for Chunk Validation Deterministic Selection: Uses PRNG seeded with observation entropy to select gateway subset Sampling Rate: Configurable percentage of gateways tested per observation (default: 1%) Minimum Guarantee: At least 1 gateway is always selected for testing Offset Selection: Random offsets within the stable weave range are chosen for each selected gateway Initial Implementation: During the initial rollout phase, only a very small portion of gateways will be checked for chunk/offset validation, and the current validation criteria are extremely lenient to ensure smooth network operation. Validation Process Chunk Retrieval: Observers request chunk data using GET /chunk/{offset} Merkle Proof Verification: Cryptographic validation ensures data integrity Early Stopping: Tests stop immediately upon first successful validation Performance Optimization: Uses LRU caching for efficient transaction lookup Fairness and Meritocracy This system ensures: Meritocratic Selection: Higher-performing gateways have better selection odds Fair Opportunity: All gateways maintain non-zero selection probability Tamper Resistance: Hashchain entropy prevents manipulation Consistent Standards: Prescribed names create common evaluation baseline The selection is saved in the contract state at epoch start to ensure that activities during the epoch do not affect selection or reward distribution.

Deficient or Failed Gateways: are gateways that fall short of the network's performance expectations, including failures in ArNS resolution or chunk/offset validation. Functional or Submitted Observers: are selected observers who diligently perform their duties and submit observation reports and contract interactions. Deficient or Failed Observers: are selected observers who do not fulfill their duty of submitting observation reports and contract interactions. Evaluation Process At the end of an epoch, the AR.IO Smart Contract processes observer submissions to determine gateway performance through a consensus-based vote tallying system. This evaluation transforms individual observer reports into network-wide performance assessments. Vote Tallying and Gateway Classification After observers submit their detailed reports (see Reporting for submission details), the smart contract performs consensus calculation: Vote Processing: Data Collection: All observer contract interactions for each gateway are collected Vote Counting: Each observer submission contributes either a PASS or FAIL vote Majority Determination: If ≥50% of submitted observer interactions indicate PASS, the gateway is considered Functional Binary Classification: Gateways are classified as either Functional (eligible for rewards) or Deficient (ineligible for rewards) Consensus Mechanism: Multiple observers evaluate each gateway independently, ensuring reliable assessment The 50% threshold requires majority agreement for positive performance determination Binary scoring provides clear, unambiguous performance classification Vote tallying occurs after the 40-minute confirmation period to ensure all interactions are finalized Chunk/Offset Validation Criteria For gateways selected for chunk/offset validation, additional performance criteria are evaluated: Validation Requirements Chunk Retrieval: Gateway must successfully respond to GET /chunk/{offset} requests Data Integrity: Chunk data must be non-empty and within reasonable size limits (<1MB) Merkle Proof Validation: Cryptographic proof must decode correctly and validate against transaction data_root Performance Standards: Response times must meet network expectations Initial Implementation: During the initial rollout phase, only a very small portion of gateways will be checked for chunk/offset validation, and the current validation criteria are extremely lenient to ensure smooth network operation.

This system ensures high availability, fast response times, and data integrity by leveraging multiple data sources with automatic fallback mechanisms. How Gateways Retrieve Data When a gateway needs to serve data, it follows a hierarchical retrieval pattern, trying each source in order until the data is successfully retrieved: Data Sources AR.IO gateways can retrieve data from multiple sources, each with different characteristics: 1. Trusted Gateways Purpose: Peer-to-peer data sharing between verified AR.IO gateways Benefits: Distributed redundancy, load balancing, network resilience Trust Mechanism: Performance-based trust scores and reciprocity monitoring Selection: Prioritized based on established trust relationships 2. AR.IO Network (Untrusted Peers) Purpose: Broader network of AR.IO gateways without established trust Benefits: Geographic distribution, expanded data availability Selection: Weighted random selection based on performance metrics Validation: Enhanced verification required due to untrusted nature 3. Chunk Assembly Purpose: Direct reconstruction from Arweave chunks via known offsets Benefits: Data integrity guarantee, no intermediary trust required Process: Fetches individual chunks efficiently and assembles them into complete data Optimization: Uses offset awareness for faster chunk retrieval 4. TX Data Purpose: Direct access to transaction data from Arweave nodes Benefits: Authoritative data source, complete historical access Trade-off: Higher latency but guaranteed availability Use Case: Final fallback when other sources fail Retrieval Strategies Gateways employ different strategies based on the use case: On-Demand Retrieval Optimized for user requests with emphasis on speed: Priority order: Trusted Gateways → Untrusted Peers (AR.IO Network) → Chunks Assembly → Arweave Aggressive timeouts: Quick fallback to next source Parallel attempts: May query multiple sources simultaneously Response streaming: Begin serving data as soon as available Background Retrieval Used specifically for unbundling and verification processes: Unbundling operations: Extracting individual data items from ANS-104 bundles Data verification: Comprehensive validation of retrieved data integrity Integrity focus: Prefers authoritative sources for accurate processing Relaxed timeouts: Allows for slower but reliable retrieval during verification Verification priority: Extensive validation before caching verified data Trust and Validation Peer Trust Management Gateways maintain sophisticated trust relationships: Trust factors include: Response performance: Latency and throughput metrics Success rates: Percentage of successful requests Data validity: Cryptographic verification results Reciprocity: Mutual data sharing behavior Data Validation Process Every piece of retrieved data undergoes validation: Hash Verification: Computed hash must match expected value Merkle Proof Validation: Chunks proven against transaction root Signature Verification: Transaction signatures validated Size Confirmation: Data size matches header declaration Why Multi-Source Retrieval Matters For Gateway Operators Reduced infrastructure costs: Leverage peer resources Improved reliability: Multiple fallback options Better performance: Optimal source selection Network effects: Benefit from collective infrastructure For Users Faster access: Data served from optimal source High availability: Multiple paths to data Geographic optimization: Nearby sources preferred Consistent experience: Transparent source selection The data retrieval system is fundamental to AR.IO's mission of providing reliable, performant access to the permaweb.

However, for all write operations, or read operations without encryption/decryption keys, you'll need a wallet. As you utilize the CLI, you can use either your wallet file or your seed phrase interchangeably. Consider the security implications of each approach for your particular use case carefully. If at any time you'd like to generate a new wallet altogether, start by generating a new seed phase. And if you'd like to use that seed phrase in the form of a wallet file, or if you'd like to recover an existing wallet via its seed phrase, use either or both of the following commands: ardrive generate-seedphrase \"this is an example twelve word seed phrase that you could use\" ardrive generate-wallet -s \"this is an example twelve word seed phrase that you could use\" > /path/to/wallet/file.json Public attributes of Arweave wallets can be retrieved via their 43-character Arweave wallet address. You can retrieve the wallet address associated with [your wallet file or 12-word seed phrase][kb-wallets] (e.g. wallets generated by [ArConnect][arconnect]) like so: ardrive get-address -w /path/to/wallet/file.json ardrive get-address -s \"this is an example twelve word seed phrase that you could use\" HTTn8F92tR32N8wuo-NIDkjmqPknrbl10JWo5MZ9x2k You'll need AR in your wallet for any write operations you perform in ArDrive.

In most cases: ```shell brew install yarn npm install -g yarn ``` # Installing and Starting the CLI From Source (/ardrive-cli/(build-and-run-from-source)/installing-and-starting-the-cli-from-source) Now that your runtime and/or development environment is set up, to install the package simply run: ```shell yarn && yarn build ``` And then start the CLI (always from the root of this repository): ```shell yarn ardrive ``` For convenience in the **non-developer case**, you can install the CLI globally on your system by performing the following step: ```shell yarn pack npm install i -g /path/to/package.tgz ardrive ``` # Recommended Visual Studio Code extensions (Developers Only) (/ardrive-cli/(build-and-run-from-source)/recommended-visual-studio-code-extensions-developers-only) To ensure your environment is compatible, we also recommend the following VSCode extensions: - [ES-Lint][eslint-vscode] - [Editor-Config][editor-config-vscode] - [Prettier][prettier-vscode] - [ZipFS][zipfs-vscode] # Using a custom ArDrive-Core-JS (Optional) (/ardrive-cli/(build-and-run-from-source)/using-a-custom-ardrive-core-js-optional) To test a with a custom version of the `ardrive-core-js` library on your local system, change the `\"ardrive-core-js\"` line in `package.json` to the root of your local `ardrive-core-js` repo: ```diff - \"ardrive-core-js\": \"1.0.0\" + \"ardrive-core-js\": \"../ardrive-core-js/\" ``` # Dealing With Network Congestion (/ardrive-cli/(other-utility-operations)/dealing-with-network-congestion) Currently, Arweave blocks hold up to 1000 transactions per block. The \"mempool\", where pending transactions reside until they've been included into a block, will only hold a transaction for 50 blocks (~100-150 minutes) before it's discarded by the network resulting in no fees or data being transacted. During periods of network congestion (i.e. those where the mempool contains 1000 or more pending transactions), it may make sense to either: a) wait for congestion to dissipate before attempting your transactions. b) apply the fee boost multiplier to your transactions rewards with the --boost parameter during write operations in order to front-run some of the congestion. #### Check for network congestion before uploading ```shell ardrive get-mempool ardrive get-mempool | jq 'length' ``` #### Front-run Congestion By Boosting Miner Rewards ```shell ardrive upload-file --wallet-file /path/to/my/wallet.json --parent-folder-id \"f0c58c11-430c-4383-8e54-4d864cc7e927\" --local-path ./helloworld.txt --boost 1.5 ``` #### Send AR Transactions From a Cold Wallet The best cold wallet storage never exposes your seed phrase and/or private keys to the Internet or a compromised system interface. You can use the ArDrive CLI to facilitate cold storage and transfer of AR. If you need a new cold AR wallet, generate one from an air-gapped machine capable of running the ArDrive CLI by following the instructions in the [Wallet Operations](#wallet-operations) section. Fund your cold wallet from whatever external sources you'd like. NOTE: Your cold wallet won't appear on chain until it has received AR. The workflow to send the AR out from your cold wallet requires you to generate a signed transaction with your cold wallet on your air-gapped machine via the ArDrive CLI, and then to transfer the signed transaction (e.g. by a file on a clean thumb drive) to an Internet-connected machine and send the transaction to the network via the ArDrive CLI. You'll need two inputs from the Internet-connected machine: - the last transaction sent OUT from the cold wallet (or an empty string if none has ever been sent out) - the base fee for an Arweave transaction (i.e. a zero bye transaction). Note that this value could change if a sufficient amount of time passes between the time you fetch this value, create the transaction, and send the transaction. To get the last transaction sent from your cold wallet, use the `last-tx` command and specify your wallet address e.g.: ``` ardrive last-tx -a \\ ``` To get the base transaction reward required for an AR transaction, use the `base-reward` function, optionally applying a reward boost multiple if you're looking to front-run network congestion: ``` ardrive base-reward --boost 1.5 ``` Write down or securely copy the values you derived from the Internet-connected machine and run the following commands on the airgapped machine, piping the outputted signed transaction data to a file in the process, e.g. `sendme.json` (if that's your signed transaction transfer medium preference): ``` ardrive create-tx -w /path/to/wallet/file.json -d \\ -a \\ --last-tx \\ --reward \"\\\" > sendme.json ``` Transport your signed transaction to the Internet-connected machine and run the following command to send your transaction to the Arweave network: ``` ardrive send-tx -x /path/to/sendme.json ``` # Monitoring Transactions (/ardrive-cli/(other-utility-operations)/monitoring-transactions) Block time on Arweave is typically between 2-3 minutes in duration, so transactions can be mined within that time frame when [network congestion](#dealing-with-network-congestion) is low. Transactions, in the general case, proceed through the following set of states: - Pending: the transaction is waiting the \"mempool\" to be mined - Confirming: the transaction was mined on an Arweave Node, but has not yet been confirmed by at least 15 total nodes on the network - Confirmed: the transaction was mined on an Arweave Node and confirmed by at least 15 total nodes on the network - Not Found: the transaction is not available for any of the following reasons: - Insufficient reward to join the mempool - Insufficient reward to be mined within 50 blocks during a period of network congestion - Transaction is transitioning between states - Transaction ID is invalid Monitor any Arweave transaction's status via its transaction ID by performing: ```shell ardrive tx-status -t \"ekSMckikdRJ8RGIkFa-X3xq3427tvM7J9adv8HP3Bzs\" ``` Example output: ```shell ekSMckikdRJ8RGIkFa-X3xq3427tvM7J9adv8HP3Bzs: Mined at block height 775810 with 22439 confirmations ``` ```shell watch -n 10 ardrive tx-status -t \"ekSMckikdRJ8RGIkFa-X3xq3427tvM7J9adv8HP3Bzs\" ``` # Persistent Caching of ArFS Entity Metadata (/ardrive-cli/(other-utility-operations)/persistent-caching-of-arfs-entity-metadata) To avoid redundant requests to the Arweave network for immutable ArFS entity metadata, a persistent file cache is created and maintained at: ``` Windows: /ardrive-caches/metadata Non-Windows: /.ardrive/caches/metadata ``` The `XDG_CACHE_HOME` environment variable is honored, where applicable, and will be used in place of `os.homedir()` in the scenarios described above. Metadata cache logging to stderr can be enabled by setting the `ARDRIVE_CACHE_LOG` environment variable to `1`. Cache performance is UNDEFINED for multi-process scenarios, but is presumed to be generally usable. The cache can be manually cleared safely at any time that any integrating app is not in operation. ```shell █████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ██╗██╗ ██╗███████╗ ██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██║██║ ██║██╔════╝ ███████║██████╔╝██║ ██║██████╔╝██║██║ ██║█████╗ ██╔══██║██╔══██╗██║ ██║██╔══██╗██║╚██╗ ██╔╝██╔══╝ ██║ ██║██║ ██║██████╔╝██║ ██║██║ ╚████╔╝ ███████╗ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═╝╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝ ╚══════╝ ██████╗██╗ ██╗ ██╔════╝██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ██║ ╚██████╗███████╗██║ ╚═════╝╚══════╝╚═╝ Write ArFS =========== create-drive create-folder upload-file create-manifest move-file move-folder retry-tx Read ArFS =========== file-info folder-info drive-info list-folder list-drive list-all-drives download-file download-folder download-drive Wallet Ops =========== generate-seedphrase generate-wallet get-address get-balance send-ar get-drive-key get-file-key last-tx Arweave Ops =========== base-reward get-mempool create-tx send-tx tx-status ardrive \\ --help ``` [ArDrive Community Discord][ardrive-discord] [ardrive]: https://ardrive.io [arweave]: https://ardrive.io/what-is-arweave/ [ardrive-github]: https://github.com/ardriveapp/ [arfs]: https://ardrive.atlassian.net/l/c/m6P1vJDo [ardrive-web-app]: https://app.ardrive.io [ardrive-core]: https://github.com/ardriveapp/ardrive-core-js [yarn-install]: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install [nvm-install]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating [wsl-install]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl [editor-config-vscode]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig [prettier-vscode]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode [zipfs-vscode]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcanis.vscode-zipfs [eslint-vscode]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint [viewblock blockchain explorer]: https://viewblock.io/arweave/ [ardrive-discord]: https://discord.com/invite/ya4hf2H [arconnect]: https://arconnect.io/ [kb-wallets]: https://ardrive.atlassian.net/l/c/FpK8FuoQ [arweave-manifests]: https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave/wiki/Path-Manifests [example-manifest-webpage]: https://arweave.net/qozq9YIUPEHfZhoTp9DkBpJuA_KNULBnfLiMroj5pZI [arlocal]: https://github.com/textury/arlocal [mozilla-mime-types]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types [viewblock]: https://viewblock.io/arweave/ [tx_anchors]: https://docs.arweave.org/developers/server/http-api#field-definitions [gql-guide]: https://gql-guide.vercel.app/#owners [ardrive-turbo]: https://ardrive.io/turbo/ # Using a Custom Arweave Gateway (/ardrive-cli/(other-utility-operations)/using-a-custom-arweave-gateway) On each command that uses a gateway, it is possible to supply your own custom Arweave gateway using the flag `--gateway` or by setting an environment variable named `ARWEAVE_GATEWAY`.

Private file functions require either the drive password or the file key. **Keys and passwords are sensitive data, so manage the entry, display, storage, and transmission of them very carefully.** Drive passwords are the most portable, and fundamental, encryption facet, so a few options are available during private drive operations for supplying them: - Environment Variable - STDIN - Secure Prompt #### Supplying Your Password: Environment Variable ```shell read -rs TMP_ARDRIVE_PW ardrive \\ -w /path/to/wallet.json -P ``` #### Supplying Your Password: STDIN ```shell cat /path/to/my/drive/password.txt | ardrive \\ -w /path/to/wallet.json -P ardrive \\ -w /path/to/wallet.json -P -w /path/to/wallet.json -P ? Enter drive password: › ******** ``` # Understanding Drive and File Keys (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-drives)/understanding-drive-and-file-keys) Private Drives achieve privacy via end-to-end encryption facilitated by hash-derived \"Keys\". Drive Keys encrypt/decrypt Drive and Folder data, and File Keys encrypt/decrypt File Data. The relationships among your data and their keys is as follows: - Drive Key = functionOf(Wallet Signature, Randomly Generated Drive ID, User-specified Drive Password) - File Key = functionOf(Randomly Generated File ID, Drive Key) When you create private entities, the returned JSON data from the ArDrive CLI will contain the keys needed to decrypt the encrypted representation of your entity that is now securely and permanently stored on the blockweave. To derive the drive key again for a drive, perform the following: ```shell ardrive get-drive-key -w /path/to/my/wallet.json -d \"6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885\" -P ``` To derive the file key again for a file, perform the following: ```shell ardrive get-file-key --file-id \"bd2ce978-6ede-4b0d-8f79-2d7bc235a0e0\" --drive-id \"6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885\" --drive-key \"yHdCjpCK3EcuhQcKNx2d/NN5ReEjoKfZVqKunlCnPEo\" ``` # Understanding Drive Hierarchies (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-drives)/understanding-drive-hierarchies) At the root of every data tree is a \"Drive\" entity. When a drive is created, a Root Folder is also created for it. The entity IDs for both are generated and returned when you create a new drive: ```shell ardrive create-drive --wallet-file /path/to/my/wallet.json --drive-name \"Teenage Love Poetry\" | tee created_drive.json | jq '[.created[] | del(.metadataTxId, .entityName, .bundledIn)]' [ { \"type\": \"drive\", \"entityId\": \"6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885\" } { \"type\": \"folder\", \"entityId\": \"d1535126-fded-4990-809f-83a06f2a1118\" } ] ``` The relationship between the drive and its root folder is clearly visible when retrieving the drive's info: ```shell ardrive drive-info -d \"6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885\" | jq '{driveId, rootFolderId}' { \"driveId\": \"6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885\", \"rootFolderId\": \"d1535126-fded-4990-809f-83a06f2a1118\" } ``` All file and folder entities in the drive will be anchored to it by a \"Drive-ID\" GQL Tag. And they'll each be anchored to a parent folder ID, tracked via the \"Parent-Folder-ID\" GQL tag, forming a tree structure whose base terminates at the Root Folder. # Dry Run (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-entities)/dry-run) An important feature of the ArDrive CLI is the `--dry-run` flag. On each command that would write an ArFS entity, there is the option to run it as a \"dry run\". This will run all of the steps and print the outputs of a regular ArFS write, but will skip sending the actual transaction: ```shell ardrive \\ \\ --dry-run ``` This can be very useful for gathering price estimations or to confirm that you've copy-pasted your entity IDs correctly before committing to an upload. # Uploading to Turbo (BETA) (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-entities)/uploading-to-turbo-beta) Users can optionally choose to send each ArFS entities created to [ArDrive Turbo][ardrive-turbo] using the `--turbo` flag. Instead of using AR from an Arweave wallet, you can use Turbo Credits or take advantage of free/discounted upload promotions. ```shell ardrive \\ \\ --turbo ``` This flag will skip any balance check on the CLI side. Turbo will check a user's balance and accept/reject a data item at the time of upload. The `--turbo` flag by default will send your files to `upload.ardrive.io` to be bundled. To change the Turbo destination, users can use the `--turbo-url` flag. # Download a Single file (BETA) (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/download-a-single-file-beta) By using the `download-file` command you can download a file on chain to a folder in your local storage specified by --local-path (or to your current working directory if not specified): ```shell ardrive download-file -w /path/to/wallet.json --file-id \"ff450770-a9cb-46a5-9234-89cbd9796610\" --local-path /my_ardrive_downloads/ ``` Specify a filename in the --local-path if you'd like to use a different name than the one that's used in your drive: ```shell ardrive download-file -w /path/to/wallet.json --file-id \"ff450770-a9cb-46a5-9234-89cbd9796610\" --local-path /my_ardrive_downloads/my_pic.png ``` # Downloading a Drive (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/downloading-a-drive) To download the whole drive you can use the `download-drive` command. ```shell ardrive download-drive -d \"c0c8ba1c-efc5-420d-a07c-a755dc67f6b2\" ``` This is equivalent to running the `download-folder` command against the root folder of the drive. # Downloading a Folder with Files (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/downloading-a-folder-with-files) You can download a folder from ArDrive to your local machine with the `download-folder` command. In the following examples, assume that a folder with ID \"47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6\" exists in your drive and is named \"MyArDriveFolder\". ```shell ardrive download-folder -f \"47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6\" ``` By specifying the `--local-path` option, you can choose the local parent folder into which the on-chain folder will be downloaded. When the parameter is omitted, its value defaults to the current working directory (i.e. `./`). ```shell ardrive download-folder -f \"47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6\" --local-path /my_ardrive_downloads/ ``` The `--max-depth` parameter lets you to choose a custom folder depth to download. When omitted, the entire subtree of the folder will be downloaded. In the following example, only the immediate children of the folder will be downloaded: ```shell ardrive download-folder -f \"47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6\" --max-depth 0 ``` The behaviors of `--local-path` are similar to those of `cp` and `mv` in Unix systems, e.g.: ```shell ardrive download-folder -f \"47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6\" --local-path \"/existing_folder\" ardrive download-folder -f \"47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6\" --local-path \"/existing_folder/MyArDriveFolder\" ardrive download-folder -f \"47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6\" --local-path \"/existing_folder/non_existent_folder\" ardrive download-folder -f \"47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6\" --local-path \"/non_existent_folder_1/non_existent_folder_2\" ``` # Fetching the Metadata of a File Entity (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/fetching-the-metadata-of-a-file-entity) Simply perform the file-info command to retrieve the metadata of a file: ```shell ardrive file-info --file-id \"e5ebc14c-5b2d-4462-8f59-7f4a62e7770f\" ``` Example output: ```shell { \"appName\": \"ArDrive-Web\", \"appVersion\": \"0.1.0\", \"arFS\": \"0.11\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\", \"driveId\": \"51062487-2e8b-4af7-bd81-4345dc28ea5d\", \"entityType\": \"file\", \"name\": \"2_depth.png\", \"txId\": \"CZKdjqwnmxbWchGA1hjSO5ZH--4OYodIGWzI-FmX28U\", \"unixTime\": 1633625081, \"size\": 41946, \"lastModifiedDate\": 1605157729000, \"parentFolderId\": \"a2c8a0cb-0ca7-4dbb-8bf8-93f75f308e63\", \"entityId\": \"e5ebc14c-5b2d-4462-8f59-7f4a62e7770f\", \"fileId\": \"e5ebc14c-5b2d-4462-8f59-7f4a62e7770f\", \"dataTxId\": \"Jz0WsWyAGVc0aE3UzACo-YJqG8OPrN3UucmDdt8Fbjc\", \"dataContentType\": \"image/png\" } ``` # IPFS CID Tagging (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/ipfs-cid-tagging) Certain nodes on the Arweave network may be running the [IPFS+Arweave bridge](https://arweave.medium.com/arweave-ipfs-persistence-for-the-interplanetary-file-system-9f12981c36c3). Tagging your file upload transaction with its IPFS v1 CID value in the 'IPFS-Add' tag may allow you to take advantage of this system. It can also be helpful for finding data on Arweave via GQL based on its CID. To include the CID tag on your **PUBLIC** file uploads, you may use the '--add-ipfs-tag' flag: ```shell ardrive upload-file --add-ipfs-tag --local-path /path/to/file.txt --parent-folder-id \"9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0\" -w /path/to/wallet.json ``` # Moving Files (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/moving-files) Files can be moved from one folder to another within the same drive. Moving a file is simply the process of uploading a new file metadata revision with an updated File ID Parent Folder ID relationship. The following command will move a file from its current location in a public drive to a new parent folder in that drive: ```shell ardrive move-file --file-id \"e5ebc14c-5b2d-4462-8f59-7f4a62e7770f\" --parent-folder-id \"a2c8a0cb-0ca7-4dbb-8bf8-93f75f308e63\" ``` # Name Conflict Resolution on Upload (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/name-conflict-resolution-on-upload) By default, the `upload-file` command will use the upsert behavior if existing entities are encountered in the destination folder tree that would cause naming conflicts. Expect the behaviors from the following table for each of these resolution settings: | Source Type | Conflict at Dest | `skip` | `replace` | `upsert` (default) | | ----------- | ---------------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------ | | File | None | Insert | Insert | Insert | | File | Matching File | Skip | Update | Skip | | File | Different File | Skip | Update | Update | | File | Folder | Skip | Fail | Fail | | Folder | None | Insert | Insert | Insert | | Folder | File | Skip | Fail | Fail | | Folder | Folder | Re-use | Re-use | Re-use | The default upsert behavior will check the destination folder for a file with a conflicting name. If no conflicts are found, it will insert (upload) the file. In the case that there is a FILE to FILE name conflict found, it will only update it if necessary. To determine if an update is necessary, upsert will compare the last modified dates of conflicting file and the file being uploaded. When they are matching, the upload will be skipped. Otherwise the file will be updated as a new revision. To override the upsert behavior, use the `--replace` option to always make new revisions of a file or the `--skip` option to always skip the upload on name conflicts: ```shell ardrive upload-file --replace --local-path /path/to/file.txt --parent-folder-id \"9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0\" -w /path/to/wallet.json ``` ```shell ardrive upload-file --skip --local-path /path/to/file.txt --parent-folder-id \"9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0\" -w /path/to/wallet.json ``` Alternatively, the upload-file commands now also supports the `--ask` conflict resolution option. This setting will always provide an interactive prompt on name conflicts that allows users to decide how to resolve each conflict found: ```shell ardrive upload-file --ask --local-file-path /path/to/file.txt --parent-folder-id \"9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0\" -w /path/to/wallet.json Destination folder has a file to file name conflict!

Return to submit. ❯ Replace as new file revision Upload with a different file name Skip this file upload ``` # Progress Logging of Transaction Uploads (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/progress-logging-of-transaction-uploads) Progress logging of transaction uploads to stderr can be enabled by setting the `ARDRIVE_PROGRESS_LOG` environment variable to `1`: ```shell Uploading file transaction 1 of total 2 transactions...

The required parameters are the file ID and the new name, as well as the owner wallet or seed phrase. ```shell ardrive rename-file --file-id \"290a3f9a-37b2-4f0f-a899-6fac983833b3\" --file-name \"My custom file name.txt\" --wallet-file \"wallet.json\" ``` # Retrying a Failed File Data Transaction (Public Unbundled Files Only) (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/retrying-a-failed-file-data-transaction-public-unbundled-files-only) Arweave data upload transactions are split into two phases: transaction posting and chunks uploading. Once the transaction post phase has been completed, you've effectively \"paid\" the network for storage of the data chunks that you'll send in the next stage. If your system encounters an error while posting the transaction, you can retry posting the transaction for as long as your tx_anchor is valid ([learn more about tx_anchors here][tx_anchors]). You may retry and/or resume posting chunks at any time after your transaction has posted. The ArDrive CLI allows you to take advantage of this Arweave protocol capability. Using the CLI, when the transaction post has succeeded but the chunk upload step fails, the data transaction's ID could be lost. There are a few options to recover this ID. If the failed transaction is the most recent one sent from a wallet, the transaction ID can be recovered with the `ardrive last-tx -w /path/to/wallet` command AFTER the transaction's headers have been mined (It can take 5-10 minutes for the tx-id to become available with the last-tx approach). Other options for finding the partially uploaded transaction's ID include: - Using an Arweave gateway GQL http endpoint to search for transactions that belong to the wallet. See this [Arweave GQL Guide][gql-guide] for more info. - Browse the recent transactions associated with the wallet via a block explorer tool like [ViewBlock][viewblock]. In order to re-seed the chunks for an unbundled ArFS data transaction, a user must have the data transaction ID, the original file data, and either a destination folder ID or a valid file ID for the file. Supply that information to the `retry-tx` command like so: ```shell ardrive retry-tx --tx-id { Data Transaction ID } --parent-folder-id { Destination Folder ID } --local-path /path/to/file --wallet-file /path/to/wallet ``` **Note: Retry feature is currently only available for PUBLIC unbundled file transactions. It is also perfectly safe to mistakenly re-seed the chunks of a healthy transaction, the transaction will remain stable and the wallet balance will not be affected.** # Understanding Bundled Transactions (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/understanding-bundled-transactions) The ArDrive CLI currently uses two different methods for uploading transactions to the Arweave network: standard transactions and Direct to Network (D2N) bundled transactions. By default, the CLI will send a D2N bundled transaction for any action that would result in multiple transactions. This bundling functionality is currently used on the `upload-file` and `create-drive` commands. D2N bundled transactions come with several benefits and implications: - Bundling saves AR and enhances ArFS reliability by sending associated ArFS transactions up as one atomic bundle. - Bundled transactions are treated as a single data transaction by the Arweave network, but can be presented as separate transactions by the Arweave Gateway once they have been \"unbundled\". - Un-bundling can take anywhere from a few minutes up to an hour. During that time, the files in the bundle will neither appear in list- commands nor be downloadable. Similarly, they will not appear in the web app after syncs until un-bundling is complete. **This can negatively affect the accuracy of upsert operations**, so it's best to wait before retrying bulk uploads. - Bundling reliability on the gateway side degrades once bundles reach either 500 data items (or ~250 files) or 500 MiB, so the CLI will create and upload multiple bundles as necessary, or will send files that are simply too large for reliable bundling as unbundled txs. # Uploading a Custom Manifest (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-a-custom-manifest) Using the custom content type feature, it is possible for users to upload their own custom manifests. The Arweave gateways use this special content type in order to identify an uploaded file as a manifest: ```shell application/x.arweave-manifest+json ``` In addition to this content type, the manifest must also adhere to the [correct JSON structure](#manifest-json) of an Arweave manifest. A user can create their own manifest from scratch, or start by piping a generated manifest to a JSON file and editing it to their specifications: ```shell ardrive create-manifest -w /path/to/wallet -f \"6c312b3e-4778-4a18-8243-f2b346f5e7cb\" --dry-run | jq '{manifest}.manifest' > my-custom-manifest.json ``` After editing the generated manifest, simply perform an `upload-file` command with the custom Arweave manifest content type to any PUBLIC folder: ```shell ardrive upload-file --content-type \"application/x.arweave-manifest+json\" --local-path my-custom-manifest.json --parent-folder-id \"9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0\" -w /path/to/wallet.json ``` The returned `dataTxId` field on the created `file` entity will be the endpoint that the manifest can be found on Arweave, just as explained in the [manifest sections](#uploading-manifests) above: ```shell https://arweave.net/{dataTxId} https://arweave.net/{dataTxId}/custom-file-1 https://arweave.net/{dataTxId}/custom-file-2 ``` # Uploading a Folder with Files (Bulk Upload) (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-a-folder-with-files-bulk-upload) Users can perform a bulk upload by using the upload-file command on a target folder. The command will reconstruct the folder hierarchy on local disk as ArFS folders on the permaweb and upload each file into their corresponding folders: ```shell ardrive upload-file --local-path /path/to/folder --parent-folder-id \"9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0\" -w /path/to/wallet.json ``` # Uploading a Non-Bundled Transaction (NOT RECOMMENDED) (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-a-non-bundled-transaction-not-recommended) While not recommended, the CLI does provide the option to forcibly send all transactions as standard transactions rather than attempting to bundle them together. To do this, simply add the `--no-bundle` flag to the `upload-file` or `create-drive` command: ```shell ardrive upload-file --no-bundle --local-path /path/to/file --parent-folder-id \"9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0\" -w /path/to/wallet.json ``` # Uploading a Single File (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-a-single-file) To upload a file, you'll need a parent folder id, the file to upload's file path, and the path to your wallet: ```shell ardrive upload-file --local-path /path/to/file.txt --parent-folder-id \"9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0\" -w /path/to/wallet.json ``` Example output: ```shell { \"created\": [ { \"type\": \"file\", \"entityName\": \"file.txt\" \"entityId\": \"6613395a-cf19-4420-846a-f88b7b765c05\" \"dataTxId\": \"l4iNWyBapfAIj7OU-nB8z9XrBhawyqzs5O9qhk-3EnI\", \"metadataTxId\": \"YfdDXUyerPCpBbGTm_gv_x5hR3tu5fnz8bM-jPL__JE\", \"bundledIn\": \"1zwdfZAIV8E26YjBs2ZQ4xjjP_1ewalvRgD_GyYw7f8\", \"sourceUri\": \"file:///path/to/file.txt\" }, { \"type\": \"bundle\", \"bundleTxId\": \"1zwdfZAIV8E26YjBs2ZQ4xjjP_1ewalvRgD_GyYw7f8\" } ], \"tips\": [ { \"txId\": \"1zwdfZAIV8E26YjBs2ZQ4xjjP_1ewalvRgD_GyYw7f8\", \"recipient\": { \"address\": \"3mxGJ4xLcQQNv6_TiKx0F0d5XVE0mNvONQI5GZXJXkt\" }, \"winston\": \"10000000\" } ], \"fees\": { \"1zwdfZAIV8E26YjBs2ZQ4xjjP_1ewalvRgD_GyYw7f8\": 42819829 } } ``` NOTE: To upload to the root of a drive, specify its root folder ID as the parent folder ID for the upload destination. You can retrieve it like so: ```shell ardrive drive-info -d \"c7f87712-b54e-4491-bc96-1c5fa7b1da50\" | jq -r '.rootFolderId' ``` # Uploading Files with Custom MetaData (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-files-with-custom-metadata) ArDrive CLI has the capability of attaching custom metadata to ArFS File and Folder MetaData Transactions during the `upload-file` command. This metadata can be applied to either the GQL tags on the MetaData Transaction and/or into the MetaData Transaction's Data JSON. All custom metadata applied must ultimately adhere to the following JSON shapes: ```ts // GQL Tags type CustomMetaDataGqlTags = Record; // Data JSON Fields type CustomMetaDataJsonFields = Record; | string | number | boolean | null | { [member: string]: JsonSerializable } | JsonSerializable[]; ``` e.g: ```shell { IPFS-Add: 'MY_HASH' } { 'Custom Name': ['Val 1', 'Val 2'] } ``` When the custom metadata is attached to the MetaData Transaction's GQL tags, they will become visible on any Arweave GQL gateway and also third party tools that read GQL data. When these tags are added to the MetaData Transaction's Data JSON they can be read by downloading the JSON data directly from `https://arweave.net/METADATA_TX_ID`. To add this custom metadata to your file metadata transactions, CLI users can pass custom metadata these parameters: - `--metadata-file path/to/json/schema` - `--metadata-json '{\"key\": \"val\", \"key-2\": true, \"key-3\": 420, \"key-4\": [\"more\", 1337]}'` - `--metadata-gql-tags \"Tag-Name\" \"Tag Val\"` The `--metadata-file` will accept a file path to JSON file containing custom metadata: ```shell ardrive upload-file --metadata-file path/to/metadata/json # ... ``` This JSON schema object must contain instructions on where to put this metadata with the `metaDataJson` and `metaDataGqlTags` keys. e.g: ```json { \"metaDataJson\": { \"Tag-Name\": [\"Value-1\", \"Value-2\"] }, \"metaDataGqlTags\": { \"GQL Tag Name\": \"Tag Value\" } } ``` The `--metadata-gql-tags` parameter accepts an array of string values to be applied to the MetaData Tx GQL Tags. This method of CLI input does not support multiple tag values for a given tag name and the input must be an EVEN number of string values. (Known bug: String values starting with the `\"-\"` character are currently not supported. Use --metadata-file parameter instead.) e.g: ```shell upload-file --metadata-gql-tags \"Custom Tag Name\" \"Custom Value\" # ... ``` And the `--metadata-json` parameter will accept a stringified JSON input. It will apply all declared JSON fields directly to the MetaData Tx's Data JSON. e.g: ```shell upload-file --metadata-json ' { \"json field\": \"value\", \"another fields\": false } ' # ... ``` Custom metadata applied to files and/or folders during the `upload-file` command will be read back through all existing read commands. e.g: ```shell ardrive file-info -f 067c4008-9cbe-422e-b697-05442f73da2b { \"appName\": \"ArDrive-CLI\", \"appVersion\": \"1.17.0\", \"arFS\": \"0.11\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\", \"driveId\": \"967215ca-a489-494b-97ec-0dd428d7be34\", \"entityType\": \"file\", \"name\": \"unique-name-9718\", \"txId\": \"sxg8bNu6_bbaHkJTxAINVVoz_F-LiFe6s7OnxzoJJk4\", \"unixTime\": 1657655070, \"size\": 262148, \"lastModifiedDate\": 1655409872705, \"dataTxId\": \"ublZcIff77ejl3m0uEA8lXEfnTWmSBOFoz-HibqKeyk\", \"dataContentType\": \"text/plain\", \"parentFolderId\": \"97bc4fb5-aca4-4ffe-938f-1285153d98ca\", \"entityId\": \"067c4008-9cbe-422e-b697-05442f73da2b\", \"fileId\": \"067c4008-9cbe-422e-b697-05442f73da2b\", \"IPFS-Add\": \"MY_HASH\", \"Tag-1\": \"Val\", \"Tag-2\": \"Val\", \"Tag-3\": \"Val\", \"Boost\": \"1.05\" } ``` #### Applying Unique Custom MetaData During Bulk Workflows With some custom scripting and the `--metadata-file` parameter, the ArDrive CLI can be used to apply custom metadata to each file individually in a bulk workflow. For example, if you choose a numbered file naming pattern you can make use of a `for` loop: ```shell for i in {1..5} do ardrive upload-file -F f0c58c11-430c-4383-8e54-4d864cc7e927 --local-path \"../uploads/test-file-$i.txt\" -w \"/path/to/wallet.json\" --metadata-file \"../custom/metadata-$i.json\" --dry-run > \"file-result-$i.json\" done ``` # Uploading From a Remote URL (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-from-a-remote-url) You can upload a file from an existing url using the `--remote-path` flag. This must be used in conjunction with `--dest-file-name`. You can use a custom content type using the `--content-type` flag, but if this isn't used the app will use the content type from the response header of the request for the remote data. ```shell ardrive upload-file --remote-path \"https://url/to/file\" --parent-folder-id \"9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0\" -d \"example.jpg\" -w /path/to/wallet.json ``` # Uploading Manifests (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-manifests) [Arweave Path Manifests][arweave-manifests] are are special `.json` files that instruct Arweave Gateways to map file data associated with specific, unique transaction IDs to customized, hosted paths relative to that of the manifest file itself. So if, for example, your manifest file had an arweave.net URL like: ```shell https://arweave.net/{manifest tx id} ``` Then, all the mapped transactions and paths in the manifest file would be addressable at URLs like: ```shell https://arweave.net/{manifest tx id}/foo.txt https://arweave.net/{manifest tx id}/bar/baz.png ``` ArDrive supports the creation of these Arweave manifests using any of your PUBLIC folders. The generated manifest paths will be links to each of the file entities within the specified folder. The manifest file entity will be created at the root of the folder. To create a manifest of an entire public drive, specify the root folder of that drive: ```shell ardrive create-manifest -f \"bc9af866-6421-40f1-ac89-202bddb5c487\" -w \"/path/to/wallet\" ``` You can also create a manifest of a folder's file entities at a custom depth by using the `--max-depth` option: ```shell ardrive create-manifest --max-depth 0 -f \"867228d8-4413-4c0e-a499-e1decbf2ea38\" -w \"/path/to/wallet\" ``` Creating a `.json` file of your manifest links output can be accomplished here with some `jq` parsing and piping to a file: ```shell ardrive create-manifest -w /path/to/wallet -f \"6c312b3e-4778-4a18-8243-f2b346f5e7cb\" | jq '{links}' > links.json ``` If you'd like to preview the contents of your manifest before uploading, you can perform a dry run and do some lightweight post processing to isolate the data: ```shell ardrive create-manifest -w /path/to/wallet -f \"6c312b3e-4778-4a18-8243-f2b346f5e7cb\" --dry-run | jq '{manifest}.manifest' ``` ```json { \"manifest\": \"arweave/paths\", \"version\": \"0.1.0\", \"index\": { \"path\": \"index.html\" }, \"paths\": { \"hello_world.txt\": { \"id\": \"Y7GFF8r9y0MEU_oi1aZeD87vrmai97JdRQ2L0cbGJ68\" }, \"index.html\": { \"id\": \"pELonjVebHyBsdxVymvxbGTmHD96v9PuuUXj8GUHGoY\" } } } ``` The manifest data transaction is tagged with a unique content-type, `application/x.arweave-manifest+json`, which tells the gateway to treat this file as a manifest. The manifest file itself is a `.json` file that holds the paths (the data transaction ids) to each file within the specified folder. When your folder is later changed by adding files or updating them with new revisions, the original manifest will NOT be updated on its own. A manifest is a permanent record of your files in their current state. However, creating a subsequent manifest with the same manifest name will create a new revision of that manifest in its new current state. Manifests follow the same name conflict resolution as outlined for files above (upsert by default). #### Hosting a Webpage with Manifest When creating a manifest, it is possible to host a webpage or web app. You can do this by creating a manifest on a folder that has an `index.html` file in its root. Using generated build folders from popular frameworks works as well. One requirement here to note is that the `href=` paths from your generated `index.html` file must not have leading a `/`. This means that the manifest will not resolve a path of `/dist/index.js` but it will resolve `dist/index.js` or `./dist/index.js`. As an example, here is a flow of creating a React app and hosting it with an ArDrive Manifest. First, generate a React app: ```shell yarn create react-app my-app ``` Next, add this field to the generated `package.json` so that the paths will resolve correctly: ```json \"homepage\": \".\", ``` Then, create an optimized production build from within the app's directory: ```shell yarn build ``` Now, we can create and upload that produced build folder on ArDrive to any of your existing ArFS folder entities: ```shell ardrive upload-file -l \"/build\" -w \"/path/to/wallet\" --parent-folder-id \"bc9af866-6421-40f1-ac89-202bddb5c487\" ``` And finally, create the manifest using the generated Folder ID from the build folder creation: ```shell ardrive create-manifest -f \"41759f05-614d-45ad-846b-63f3767504a4\" -w \"/path/to/wallet\" ``` In the return output, the top link will be a link to the deployed web app: ```shell \"links\": [ \"https://arweave.net/0MK68J8TqGhaaOpPe713Zn0jdpczMt2NGS2CtRYiuAg\", \"https://arweave.net/0MK68J8TqGhaaOpPe713Zn0jdpczMt2NGS2CtRYiuAg/asset-manifest.json\", \"https://arweave.net/0MK68J8TqGhaaOpPe713Zn0jdpczMt2NGS2CtRYiuAg/favicon.ico\", \"https://arweave.net/0MK68J8TqGhaaOpPe713Zn0jdpczMt2NGS2CtRYiuAg/index.html\", # ... ``` This is effectively hosting a web app with ArDrive. Check out the ArDrive Price Calculator React App hosted as an [ArDrive Manifest][example-manifest-webpage]. # Uploading Multiple Files (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-multiple-files) To upload an arbitrary number of files or folders, pass a space-separated list of paths to `--local-paths`: ```shell ardrive upload-file -w wallet.json -F \"6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885\" --local-paths ./image.png ~/backups/ ../another_file.txt ardrive upload-file -w wallet.json -F \"6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885\" --local-paths ./*.json ``` # Uploading With a Custom Content Type (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-with-a-custom-content-type) Each file uploaded to the Arweave network receives a `\"Content-Type\"` GraphQL tag that contains the MIME type for the file. The gateway will use this content type to determine how to serve that file's data transaction at the `arweave.net/{data tx id}` endpoint. By default, the CLI will attempt to derive this content type from the file extension of the provided file. In most cases, the content type that is derived will be correct and the gateway will properly serve the file. The CLI also provides the option for users to upload files with a custom content type using the `--content-type` flag: ```shell ardrive upload-file --content-type \"application/json\" --local-path /path/to/file --parent-folder-id \"9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0\" -w /path/to/wallet.json ``` It is currently possible to set this value to any given string, but the gateway will still only serve valid content types. Check out this list of commonly used MIME types to ensure you're providing a valid content type: [Common MIME types][mozilla-mime-types]. Note: In the case of multi-file uploads or recursive folder uploads, setting this `--content-type` flag will set the provided custom content type on EVERY file entity within a given upload. # Creating Folders (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-folders)/creating-folders) Creating folders manually is straightforward: ```shell ardrive create-folder --parent-folder-id \"63153bb3-2ca9-4d42-9106-0ce82e793321\" --folder-name \"My Awesome Folder\" -w /path/to/wallet.json ``` Example output: ```shell { \"created\": [ { \"type\": \"folder\", \"metadataTxId\": \"AYFMBVmwqhbg9y5Fbj3Iasy5oxUqhauOW7PcS1sl4Dk\", \"entityId\": \"d1b7c514-fb12-4603-aad8-002cf63015d3\", \"key\": \"yHdCjpCKD2cuhQcKNx2d/XF5ReEjoKfZVqKunlCnPEk\", \"entityName\": \"My Awesome Folder\" } ], \"tips\": [], \"fees\": { \"AYFMBVmwqhbg9y5Fbj3Iasy5oxUqhauOW7PcS1sl4Dk\": 1378052 } } ``` Note: Folders can also be created by supplying a folder as the --local-path of an upload-file command. In this case, the folder hierarchy on the local disk will be reconstructed on chain during the course of the recursive bulk upload. # Listing Contents of a Folder (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-folders)/listing-contents-of-a-folder) Similar to drives, the `list-folder` command can be used to fetch the metadata of each entity within a folder. But by default, the command will fetch only the immediate children of that folder (`--max-depth 0`): ```shell ardrive list-folder --parent-folder-id \"29850ab7-56d4-4e1f-a5be-cb86d5513940\" ``` Example output: ```shell [ { \"appName\": \"ArDrive-CLI\", \"appVersion\": \"2.0\", \"arFS\": \"0.11\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\", \"driveId\": \"01ea6ba3-9e58-42e7-899d-622fd110211a\", \"entityType\": \"folder\", \"name\": \"mytestfolder\", \"txId\": \"HYiKyfLwY7PT9NleTQoTiM_-qPVUwf4ClDhx1sjUAEU\", \"unixTime\": 1635102772, \"parentFolderId\": \"29850ab7-56d4-4e1f-a5be-cb86d5513940\", \"entityId\": \"03df2929-1440-4ab4-bbf0-9dc776e1ed96\", \"path\": \"/My Public Folder/mytestfolder\", \"txIdPath\": \"/09_x0X2eZ3flXXLS72WdTDq6uaa5g2LjsT-QH1m0zhU/HYiKyfLwY7PT9NleTQoTiM_-qPVUwf4ClDhx1sjUAEU\", \"entityIdPath\": \"/29850ab7-56d4-4e1f-a5be-cb86d5513940/03df2929-1440-4ab4-bbf0-9dc776e1ed96\" }, { \"appName\": \"ArDrive-CLI\", \"appVersion\": \"2.0\", \"arFS\": \"0.11\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\", \"driveId\": \"01ea6ba3-9e58-42e7-899d-622fd110211a\", \"entityType\": \"folder\", \"name\": \"Super sonic public folder\", \"txId\": \"VUk1B_vo1va2-EHLtqjsotzy0Rdn6lU4hQo3RD2xoTI\", \"unixTime\": 1631283259, \"parentFolderId\": \"29850ab7-56d4-4e1f-a5be-cb86d5513940\", \"entityId\": \"452c6aec-43dc-4015-9abd-20083068d432\", \"path\": \"/My Public Folder/Super sonic sub folder\", \"txIdPath\": \"/09_x0X2eZ3flXXLS72WdTDq6uaa5g2LjsT-QH1m0zhU/VUk1B_vo1va2-EHLtqjsotzy0Rdn6lU4hQo3RD2xoTI\", \"entityIdPath\": \"/29850ab7-56d4-4e1f-a5be-cb86d5513940/452c6aec-43dc-4015-9abd-20083068d432\" }, { \"appName\": \"ArDrive-CLI\", \"appVersion\": \"2.0\", \"arFS\": \"0.11\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\", \"driveId\": \"01ea6ba3-9e58-42e7-899d-622fd110211a\", \"entityType\": \"file\", \"name\": \"test-number-twelve.txt\", \"txId\": \"429zBqnd7ZBNzgukaix26RYz3g5SeXCCo_oIY6CPZLg\", \"unixTime\": 1631722234, \"size\": 47, \"lastModifiedDate\": 1631722217028, \"dataTxId\": \"vA-BxAS7I6n90cH4Fzsk4cWS3EOPb1KOhj8yeI88dj0\", \"dataContentType\": \"text/plain\", \"parentFolderId\": \"29850ab7-56d4-4e1f-a5be-cb86d5513940\", \"entityId\": \"e5948327-d6de-4acf-a6fe-e091ecf78d71\", \"path\": \"/My Public Folder/test-number-twelve.txt\", \"txIdPath\": \"/09_x0X2eZ3flXXLS72WdTDq6uaa5g2LjsT-QH1m0zhU/429zBqnd7ZBNzgukaix26RYz3g5SeXCCo_oIY6CPZLg\", \"entityIdPath\": \"/29850ab7-56d4-4e1f-a5be-cb86d5513940/e5948327-d6de-4acf-a6fe-e091ecf78d71\" }, { \"appName\": \"ArDrive-CLI\", \"appVersion\": \"2.0\", \"arFS\": \"0.11\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\", \"driveId\": \"01ea6ba3-9e58-42e7-899d-622fd110211a\", \"entityType\": \"file\", \"name\": \"wonderful-test-file.txt\", \"txId\": \"6CokwlzB81Fx7dq-lB654VM0XQykdU6eYohDmEJ2gk4\", \"unixTime\": 1631671275, \"size\": 23, \"lastModifiedDate\": 1631283389232, \"dataTxId\": \"UP8THwA_1gvyRqNRqYmTpWvU4-UzNWBN7SiX_AIihg4\", \"dataContentType\": \"text/plain\", \"parentFolderId\": \"29850ab7-56d4-4e1f-a5be-cb86d5513940\", \"entityId\": \"3274dae9-3487-41eb-94d5-8d5d3d8bc343\", \"path\": \"/My Public Folder/wonderful-test-file.txt\", \"txIdPath\": \"/09_x0X2eZ3flXXLS72WdTDq6uaa5g2LjsT-QH1m0zhU/6CokwlzB81Fx7dq-lB654VM0XQykdU6eYohDmEJ2gk4\", \"entityIdPath\": \"/29850ab7-56d4-4e1f-a5be-cb86d5513940/3274dae9-3487-41eb-94d5-8d5d3d8bc343\" } ] ``` To list further than the immediate children, you can make use of the flags: `--all` and `--max-depth`. ```shell ardrive list-folder --parent-folder-id \"9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0\" --all ardrive list-folder --parent-folder-id \"9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0\" --max-depth 2 ``` In the case of private entitites, the `--with-keys` flag will make the command to include the keys in the output. ```shell ardrive list-folder --parent-folder-id \"1b027047-4cfc-4eee-88a8-9af694f660c0\" -w /my/wallet.json --with-keys ``` # Moving Folders (/ardrive-cli/(working-with-folders)/moving-folders) Moving a folder is as simple as supplying a new parent folder ID.

To simply install the latest version of the CLI to your local system and get started, follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start) instructions. To build and/or develop the CLI from source, follow the [Build and Run from Source](#build-and-run-from-source) instructions. In either case, be sure to satisfy the requirements in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. # Limitations (/ardrive-cli/limitations) **Number of files in a bulk upload:** Theoretically unlimited **Max individual file size**: 2GB (Node.js limitation) **Max file name length**: 255 bytes **Max ANS-104 bundled transaction size:** 500 MiB per bundle. App will handle creating multiple bundles. **Max ANS-104 data item counts per bundled transaction:** 250 Files per bundle (500 Data Items). # Using the CLI # Wallet Operations (/ardrive-cli/wallet-operations) Browsing of ArDrive public data is possible without the need for an [Arweave wallet][kb-wallets]. However, for all write operations, or read operations without encryption/decryption keys, you'll need a wallet. As you utilize the CLI, you can use either your wallet file or your seed phrase interchangeably. Consider the security implications of each approach for your particular use case carefully. If at any time you'd like to generate a new wallet altogether, start by generating a new seed phase. And if you'd like to use that seed phrase in the form of a wallet file, or if you'd like to recover an existing wallet via its seed phrase, use either or both of the following commands: ```shell ardrive generate-seedphrase \"this is an example twelve word seed phrase that you could use\" ardrive generate-wallet -s \"this is an example twelve word seed phrase that you could use\" > /path/to/wallet/file.json ``` Public attributes of Arweave wallets can be retrieved via their 43-character Arweave wallet address. You can retrieve the wallet address associated with [your wallet file or 12-word seed phrase][kb-wallets] (e.g. wallets generated by [ArConnect][arconnect]) like so: ```shell ardrive get-address -w /path/to/wallet/file.json ardrive get-address -s \"this is an example twelve word seed phrase that you could use\" HTTn8F92tR32N8wuo-NIDkjmqPknrbl10JWo5MZ9x2k ``` You'll need AR in your wallet for any write operations you perform in ArDrive. You can always check your wallet balance (in both AR and Winston units) by performing: ```shell ardrive get-balance -w /path/to/wallet/file.json ardrive get-balance -a \"HTTn8F92tR32N8wuo-NIDkjmqPknrbl10JWo5MZ9x2k\" 1500000000000 Winston 1.5 AR ``` If, at any time, you need to send AR out of your wallet to another wallet address, you may perform: ```shell ardrive send-ar -w /path/to/wallet/file.json --dest-address \"HTTn8F92tR32N8wuo-NIDkjmqPknrbl10JWo5MZ9x2k\" --ar-amount 2.12345 ```","estimatedWords":6946,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:10:54.322Z","breadcrumbs":["sdks","(clis)","llm.txt"],"siteKey":"ario","siteName":"AR-IO Network","depth":4,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:10:54.322Z"},{"url":"https://docs.ar.io/sdks/turbo-sdk/turbounauthenticatedclient","title":"TurboUnauthenticatedClient","content":"Turbo SDKAPIsTurboUnauthenticatedClientCopy MarkdownOpengetSupportedCurrencies() Returns the list of currencies supported by the Turbo Payment Service for topping up a user balance of AR Credits (measured in Winston Credits, or winc). getSupportedCountries() Returns the list of countries supported by the Turbo Payment Service's top up workflow. getFiatToAR() Returns the current raw fiat to AR conversion rate for a specific currency as reported by third-party pricing oracles. getFiatRates() Returns the current fiat rates for 1 GiB of data for supported currencies, including all top-up adjustments and fees. getWincForFiat() Returns the current amount of Winston Credits including all adjustments for the provided fiat currency. const { winc, actualPaymentAmount, quotedPaymentAmount, adjustments } = await turbo.getWincForFiat({ amount: USD(100), }); getWincForToken() Returns the current amount of Winston Credits including all adjustments for the provided token amount. const { winc, actualTokenAmount, equivalentWincTokenAmount } = await turbo.getWincForToken({ tokenAmount: WinstonToTokenAmount(100_000_000), }); getFiatEstimateForBytes() Get the current price from the Turbo Payment Service, denominated in the specified fiat currency, for uploading a specified number of bytes to Turbo. const { amount } = await turbo.getFiatEstimateForBytes({ byteCount: 1024 * 1024 * 1024, currency: 'usd',","estimatedWords":181,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:10:55.354Z","breadcrumbs":["sdks","turbo sdk","turbounauthenticatedclient"],"siteKey":"ario","siteName":"AR-IO Network","depth":4,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:10:55.354Z"},{"url":"https://docs.ar.io/sdks/ar-io-sdk/static-methods","title":"Static Methods","content":"AR.IO SDKANT ContractsStatic MethodsCopy MarkdownOpenANT.fork() Forks an existing ANT process to create a new one with the same state but potentially a different module.

Key-value tags in the headers provide for expressive description about the data as well as searchability via gateway GraphQL APIs. ArFS adds an additional layer of separation between data and metadata by using separate transactions for ArFS metadata and, where applicable, ArFS file data. But it also makes use of tags and data separation within an ArFS metadata transaction by including data critical to tracking drive composition in the tags space of ArFS metadata transactions and having most of the other metadata encoded as JSON in the data body of the metadata transaction. In the case of private entities, JSON data and file data payloads are always encrypted according to the protocol processes defined below. Drive entities require a single metadata transaction, with standard Drive tags and encoded JSON with secondary metadata. Folder entities require a single metadata transaction, with standard Folder tags and an encoded JSON with secondary metadata. File entities require a metadata transaction, with standard File tags and an encoded Data JSON with secondary metadata relating to the file. File entities also require a second data transaction, which includes a limited set of File tags and the actual file data itself. Snapshot entities require a single transaction, which contains a Data JSON with all of the Drive's rolled up ArFS metadata and standard Snapshot GQL tags that identify the Snapshot. ArFS v0.14 introduces the isHidden property. isHidden is a boolean (true/false) that tells clients if they should display the file or folder. Hidden files still exist and will be included in snapshots, but should not be rendered by clients. If isHidden is not present, its value should be assumed false. ArFS v0.15 introduces the Signature-Type metadata property on Drive entities, and a new entity type DriveSignature. Drive A drive is the highest level logical grouping of folders and files. All folders and files must be part of a drive, and reference the Drive ID of that drive. When creating a Drive, a corresponding \"root\" folder must be created as well. This separation of drive and folder entity enables features such as folder view queries, renaming, and linking. ArFS: \"0.15\", Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\", Cipher-IV?: \"\", Content-Type: \"\", Drive-Id: \"\", Drive-Privacy: \"\", Drive-Auth-Mode?: \"password\", Entity-Type: \"drive\", Signature-Type?: \"1\", Unix-Time: \"\" Metadata JSON { \"name\": \"\", \"rootFolderId\": \"\", \"isHidden\": false } Drive-Signature ArFS versions prior to v0.15 applied encryption to drive contents with a signing scheme that, while secure, is now deprecated in modern Arweave software wallets. ArFS v0.15 introduces an updated signing scheme compatible with these wallets and as well as \"Drive Signatures\", a new entity type to help bridge the signature derivation schemes across ArFS versions. A drive signature uses the v0.15 encryption scheme to encrypt and store the pre-v0.15 wallet signature for a private drive that is necessary for deriving the \"drive key\" for that drive. This allows for continued access of historical drive contents into the future. ArFS: \"0.15\", Entity-Type: \"drive-signature\", Signature-Format: \"1\", Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\", Cipher-IV: \"\" {data: } The encrypted \"type 1\" signature for the drive must be provided in the data field of the transaction creating the drive-signature entity. Folder A folder is a logical grouping of other folders and files. Folder entity metadata transactions without a parent folder id are considered the Drive Root Folder of their corresponding Drives. All other Folder entities must have a parent folder id. Since folders do not have underlying data, there is no Folder data transaction required. ArFS: \"0.15\", Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\", Cipher-IV?: \"\", Content-Type: \"\", Drive-Id: \"\", Entity-Type: \"folder\", Folder-Id: \"\", Parent-Folder-Id?: \"\", Unix-Time: \"\" Metadata JSON { \"name\": \"\", \"isHidden\": false } File A File contains uploaded data, like a photo, document, or movie. In the Arweave File System, a single file is broken into 2 parts - its metadata and its data. A File entity metadata transaction does not include the actual File data. Instead, the File data must be uploaded as a separate transaction, called the File Data Transaction. The File JSON metadata transaction contains a reference to the File Data Transaction ID so that it can retrieve the actual data. This separation allows for file metadata to be updated without requiring the file itself to be reuploaded. It also ensures that private files can have their JSON Metadata Transaction encrypted as well, ensuring that no one without authorization can see either the file or its metadata. ArFS: \"0.15\", Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\", Cipher-IV?: \"\", Content-Type: \"\", Drive-Id: \"\", Entity-Type: \"file\", File-Id: \"\", Parent-Folder-Id: \"\", Unix-Time: \"\" Metadata JSON { \"name\": \"\", \"size\": , \"lastModifiedDate\": , \"dataTxId\": \"\", \"dataContentType\": \"\", \"isHidden\": false, \"pinnedDataOwner\": \"\", # Optional } Pinning Files Since the version v0.13, ArFS supports Pins. Pins are files whose data may be any transaction uploaded to Arweave, that may or may not be owned by the wallet that created the pin. When a new File Pin is created, the only created transaction is the Metadata Transaction. The dataTxId field will point it to any transaction in Arweave, and the optional pinnedDataOwner field is gonna hold the address of the wallet that owns the original copy of the data transaction. File Data Transaction Example The File Data Transaction contains limited information about the file, such as the information required to decrypt it, or the Content-Type (mime-type) needed to view in the browser. Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\", Cipher-IV?: \"\", Content-Type: \"\", { File Data - Encrypted if private } File Metadata Transaction Example The File Metadata Transaction contains the GQL Tags necessary to identify the file within a drive and folder. Its data contains the JSON metadata for the file. This includes the file name, size, last modified date, data transaction id, and data content type. ArFS: \"0.15\", Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\", Cipher-IV?: \"\", Content-Type: \"\", Drive-Id: \"\", Entity-Type: \"file\", File-Id: \"\", Parent-Folder-Id: \"\", Unix-Time: \"\", { File JSON Metadata - Encrypted if private } Snapshot ArFS applications generate the latest state of a drive by querying for all ArFS transactions made relating to a user's particular Drive-Id. This includes both paged queries for indexed ArFS data via GQL, as well as the ArFS JSON metadata entries for each ArFS transaction. For small drives (less than 1000 files), a few thousand requests for very small volumes of data can be achieved relatively quickly and reliably. For larger drives, however, this results in long sync times to pull every piece of ArFS metadata when the local database cache is empty. This can also potentially trigger rate-limiting related ArWeave Gateway delays. Once a drive state has been completely, and accurately generated, in can be rolled up into a single snapshot and uploaded as an Arweave transaction. ArFS clients can use GQL to find and retrieve this snapshot in order to rapidly reconstitute the total state of the drive, or a large portion of it. They can then query individual transactions performed after the snapshot. This optional method offers convenience and resource efficiency when building the drive state, at the cost of paying for uploading the snapshot data. Using this method means a client will only have to iterate through a few snapshots instead of every transaction performed on the drive. Snapshot Entity Tags Snapshot entities require the following tags. These are queried by ArFS clients to find drive snapshots, organize them together with any other transactions not included within them, and build the latest state of the drive. ArFS: \"0.15\", Drive-Id: \"\", Entity-Type: \"snapshot\", Snapshot-Id: \"\", Content-Type: \"\", Block-Start: \"\", Block-End: \"\", Data-Start: \"\" Snapshot Entity Data A JSON data object must also be uploaded with every ArFS Snapshot entity. This data contains all ArFS Drive, Folder, and File metadata changes within the associated drive, as well as any previous Snapshots. The Snapshot Data contains an array txSnapshots. Each item includes both the GQL and ArFS metadata details of each transaction made for the associated drive, within the snapshot's start and end period. A tsSnapshot contains a gqlNode object which uses the same GQL tags interface returned by the Arweave Gateway. It includes all of the important block, owner, tags, and bundledIn information needed by ArFS clients. It also contains a dataJson object which stores the correlated Data JSON for that ArFS entity. For private drives, the dataJson object contains the JSON-string-escaped encrypted text of the associated file or folder. This encrypted text uses the file's existing Cipher and Cipher-IV. This ensures clients can decrypt this information quickly using the existing ArFS privacy protocols. { \"txSnapshots\": [ { \"gqlNode\": { \"id\": \"bWCvIc3cOzwVgquD349HUVsn5Dd1_GIri8Dglok41Vg\", \"owner\": { \"address\": \"hlWRbyJ6WUoErm3b0wqVgd1l3LTgaQeLBhB36v2HxgY\" }, \"bundledIn\": { \"id\": \"39n5evzP1Ip9MhGytuFm7F3TDaozwHuVUbS55My-MBk\" }, \"block\": { \"height\": 1062005, \"timestamp\": 1669053791 }, \"tags\": [ { \"name\": \"Content-Type\", \"value\": \"application/json\" }, { \"name\": \"ArFS\", \"value\": \"0.11\" }, { \"name\": \"Entity-Type\", \"value\": \"drive\" }, { \"name\": \"Drive-Id\", \"value\": \"f27abc4b-ed6f-4108-a9f5-e545fc4ff55b\" }, { \"name\": \"Drive-Privacy\", \"value\": \"public\" }, { \"name\": \"App-Name\", \"value\": \"ArDrive-App\" }, { \"name\": \"App-Platform\", \"value\": \"Web\" }, { \"name\": \"App-Version\", \"value\": \"1.39.0\" }, { \"name\": \"Unix-Time\", \"value\": \"1669053323\" } ] }, \"dataJson\": \"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"november\\\",\\\"rootFolderId\\\":\\\"71dfc1cb-5368-4323-972a-e9dd0b1c63a0\\\", \\\"isHidden\\\":false}\" } ] } Schema Diagrams The following diagrams show complete examples of Drive, Folder, and File entity Schemas.

ArFS works around this by defining an append-only transaction data model based on the metadata tags found in the Arweave Transaction Headers. This model uses a bottom-up reference method, which avoids race conditions in file system updates. Each file contains metadata that refers to the parent folder, and each folder contains metadata that refers to its parent drive. A top-down data model would require the parent model (i.e. a folder) to store references to its children. These defined entities allow the state of the drive to be constructed by a client to look and feel like a file system: Drive Entities contain folders and files Folder Entities contain other folders or files File Entities contain both the file data and metadata Snapshot entities contain a state rollups of all entities' (such as drive, folder, file and snapshot) metadata within a drive Entity Relationships The following diagram shows the high level relationships between drive, folder, and file entities, and their associated data. More detailed information about each Entity Type can be found in the ArFS specification documentation. As you can see, each file and folder contains metadata which points to both the parent folder and the parent drive. The drive entity contains metadata about itself, but not the child contents. So clients must build drive states from the lowest level and work their way up. Metadata Format Metadata stored in any Arweave transaction tag will be defined in the following manner: { \"name\": \"Example-Tag\", \"value\": \"example-data\" } Metadata stored in the Transaction Data Payload will follow JSON formatting like below: { \"exampleField\": \"exampleData\" } Fields with a ? suffix are optional. { \"name\": \"My Project\", \"description\": \"This is a sample project.\", \"version?\": \"1.0.0\", \"author?\": \"John Doe\" } Enumerated field values (those which must adhere to certain values) are defined in the format \"value 1 | value 2\". All UUIDs used for Entity-Ids are based on the Universally Unique Identifier standard. There are no requirements to list ArFS tags in any specific order. Building Drive State To construct the current state of a drive, clients must: Query for all entities associated with a specific Drive-Id Sort by block height to establish chronological order Process entities bottom-up starting with files and folders Build the hierarchy by following parent-child relationships Handle conflicts by using the most recent entity version Example Drive State Construction Entity Lifecycle Each ArFS entity follows a specific lifecycle pattern: Creation Generate unique UUID for entity Create metadata transaction with required tags For files: create separate data transaction Upload to Arweave network Updates Create new entity with same ID Update metadata as needed Upload new transaction Client processes both versions and uses latest Deletion Mark entity as hidden (isHidden: true) Upload new transaction Entity remains in history but hidden from UI Data Integrity ArFS ensures data integrity through: Immutable transactions - Once uploaded, data cannot be modified Cryptographic signatures - All transactions are signed by the owner Version tracking - Multiple versions of entities can exist Conflict resolution - Clients use block height and timestamps to resolve conflicts Performance Considerations For large drives, consider these optimization strategies: Use snapshots for quick state reconstruction Implement caching for frequently accessed data Batch operations when possible Query by date ranges to limit data transfer Next Steps Now that you understand the ArFS data model, learn how to work with it: Privacy & Encryption - Secure your data with private drives Creating Drives - Start building with ArFS Reading Data - Query and retrieve your data How is this guide?GoodBadEntity TypesUnderstanding ArFS entity types and their structurePrivacy & EncryptionSecure your data with ArFS private drives and encryption","estimatedWords":632,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:11:11.976Z","breadcrumbs":["build","advanced","arfs","data model"],"siteKey":"ario","siteName":"AR-IO Network","depth":4,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:11:11.976Z"},{"url":"https://docs.ar.io/build/advanced/arfs/privacy","title":"Privacy  Encryption","content":"AdvancedArFS ProtocolPrivacy & EncryptionCopy MarkdownOpenThe Arweave blockweave is inherently public. But with apps that use ArFS, like ArDrive, your private data never leaves your computer without using military grade (and quantum resistant) encryption. This privacy layer is applied at the Drive level, and users determine whether a Drive is public or private when they first create it. Private drives must follow the ArFS privacy model. With ArDrive specifically, every file within a Private Drive is symmetrically encrypted using AES-256-GCM (for small files and metadata transactions) or AES-256-CTR (for large files, over 100MiB). Every Private drive has a master \"Drive Key\" which uses a combination of the user's Arweave wallet signature, a user defined drive password, and a unique drive identifier (uuidv4). Each file has its own \"File Key\" derived from the \"Drive Key\". This allows for single files to be shared without exposing access to the other files within the Drive. Once a file is encrypted and stored on Arweave, it is locked forever and can only be decrypted using its file key. NOTE: Usable encryption standards are not limited to AES-256-GCM or AES-256-CTR. Any Encryption method may be used so long as it is clearly indicated in the cipher tag. Deriving Keys Private drives have a global drive key, D, and multiple file keys F, for encryption. This enables a drive to have as many uniquely encrypted files as needed. One key is used for all versions of a single file (since new file versions use the same File-Id) D is used for encrypting both Drive and Folder metadata, while F is used for encrypting File metadata and the actual stored data. Having these different keys, D and F, allows a user to share specific files without revealing the contents of their entire drive. D is derived using HKDF-SHA256 with an unsalted RSA-PSS signature of the drive's id and a user provided password. F is also derived using HKDF-SHA256 with the drive key and the file's id. Other wallets (like ArConnect) integrate with this Key Derivation protocol just exposing an API to collect a signature from a given Arweave Wallet in order to get the SHA-256 signature needed for the HKDF to derive the Drive Key. An example implementation, using Dart, is available here, with a Typescript implementation here. Private Drives Drives can store either public or private data. This is indicated by the Drive-Privacy tag in the Drive entity metadata. Drive-Privacy: \"\" If a Drive entity is private, an additional tag Drive-Auth-Mode must also be used to indicate how the Drive Key is derived. ArDrive clients currently leverage a secure password along with the Arweave Wallet private key signature to derive the global Drive Key. Drive-Auth-Mode?: 'password' On every encrypted Drive Entity, a Cipher tag must be specified, along with the public parameters for decrypting the data. This is done by specifying the parameter with a Cipher-* tag. eg. Cipher-IV. If the parameter is byte data, it must be encoded as Base64 in the tag. ArDrive clients currently leverage AES256-GCM for all symmetric encryption, which requires a Cipher Initialization Vector consisting of 12 random bytes. Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\" Cipher-IV?: \"\" Additionally, all encrypted transactions must have the Content-Type tag application/octet-stream as opposed to application/json Private Drive Entities and their corresponding Root Folder Entities will both use these keys and ciphers generated to symmetrically encrypt the JSON files that are included in the transaction. This ensures that only the Drive Owner (and whomever the keys have been shared with) can open the drive, discover the root folder, and continue to load the rest of the children in the drive. Private Files When a file is uploaded to a private drive, it by default also becomes private and leverages the same drive keys used for its parent drive. Each unique file in a drive will get its own set of file keys based off of that file's unique FileId. If a single file gets a new version, its File-Id will be reused, effectively leveraging the same File Key for all versions in that file's history. These file keys can be shared by the drive's owner as needed. Private File entities have both its metadata and data transactions encrypted using the same File Key, ensuring all facets of the data is truly private. As such, both the file's metadata and data transactions must both have a unique Cipher-IV and Cipher tag: Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\" Cipher-IV?: \"\" Just like drives, private files must have the Content-Type tag set as application/octet-stream in both its metadata and data transactions: Content-Type: \"application/octet-stream\" Encryption Process Here's how the encryption process works for private drives: Security Best Practices When working with private drives, follow these security guidelines: Password Management Use strong, unique passwords for each drive Consider using a password manager Never share passwords in plain text Key Storage Never store drive keys in plain text Use secure key derivation functions Implement proper key rotation if needed Access Control Share file keys only with authorized users Implement proper access logging Regularly audit drive access Data Handling Encrypt data before transmission Use secure communication channels Implement proper error handling Drive Signature (ArFS v0.15) ArFS v0.15 introduces a new Drive-Signature entity type to help bridge signature derivation schemes across ArFS versions. This is particularly important for maintaining access to private drives created with older wallet signing methods. The drive signature entity stores an encrypted version of the pre-v0.15 wallet signature that's necessary for deriving the drive key. This allows continued access to historical drive contents while using modern wallet signing APIs. Next Steps Ready to implement privacy in your ArFS applications?

New Drive Entity The user must specify a name of the drive which is stored within the Drive Entity's metadata JSON. ArDrive generates a new unique uuidv4 for the drive entity's Drive-Id. ArDrive also generates a new unique uuidv4 for the drive entity's rootFolderId, which will refer to the Folder-Id of the new folder entity that will be created. This rootFolderId is stored within the Drive Entity's metadata JSON. Drive Entity Metadata transactions must have Entity-Type: \"drive\". ArDrive will that the current local system time as seconds since Unix epoch for the Drive Entity's Unix-Time. The Drive Entity's Drive-Privacy must also be set to public or private in order for its subfolders and files to have the correct security settings. If the drive is private: Its Cipher tag must be filled out with the correct encryption algorithm (currently AES256-GCM). Its Cipher-IV tag must be filled out with the generated Initialization Vector for the private drive. The ArFS client must derive the Drive Key and encrypt the Drive Entity's metadata JSON using the assigned Cipher and Cipher-IV. New Root Folder Entity The name of the drive and folder entities must be the same. This name is stored within the Folder Entity's metadata JSON. The Folder Entity's Folder-Id must match the rootFolderId previously created for the Drive Entity. The Folder Entity's Drive-Id must match the Drive-Id previously created for the Drive Entity. The Folder Entity must not include a Parent-Folder-Id tag. This is how it is determined to be the root folder for a drive. Folder Entity metadata transactions must have Entity-Type: 'folder'. The client gets the user's local time for the Unix-Time tag, represented as seconds since Unix Epoch. Public folders must have the content type Content-Type: \"application/json\". If the folder is private Its Cipher tag must be filled out with the correct encryption algorithm (currently AES256-GCM). Its Cipher-IV tag must be filled out with the generated Initialization Vector for the private folder. Its content type must be Content-Type: \"application/octet-stream\". The ArFS client must encrypt the Drive Entity's metadata JSON using the assigned Cipher and Cipher-IV. Creating Files Files in ArFS require two separate transactions: File Metadata Transaction - Contains file information and references File Data Transaction - Contains the actual file data File Metadata Transaction ArFS: \"0.15\", Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\", Cipher-IV?: \"\", Content-Type: \"\", Drive-Id: \"\", Entity-Type: \"file\", File-Id: \"\", Parent-Folder-Id: \"\", Unix-Time: \"\" Metadata JSON { \"name\": \"\", \"size\": , \"lastModifiedDate\": , \"dataTxId\": \"\", \"dataContentType\": \"\", \"isHidden\": false, \"pinnedDataOwner\": \"\" } File Data Transaction Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\", Cipher-IV?: \"\", Content-Type: \"\", { File Data - Encrypted if private } Creating Folders Folders are simpler than files as they only require a metadata transaction: ArFS: \"0.15\", Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\", Cipher-IV?: \"\", Content-Type: \"\", Drive-Id: \"\", Entity-Type: \"folder\", Folder-Id: \"\", Parent-Folder-Id?: \"\", Unix-Time: \"\" Metadata JSON { \"name\": \"\", \"isHidden\": false } Creating Snapshots Snapshots provide a way to quickly synchronize drive state by rolling up all metadata into a single transaction: ArFS: \"0.15\", Drive-Id: \"\", Entity-Type: \"snapshot\", Snapshot-Id: \"\", Content-Type: \"\", Block-Start: \"\", Block-End: \"\", Data-Start: \"\", Data-End: \"\", Unix-Time: \"\" Implementation Example Here's a practical example of creating a complete drive structure: Best Practices Naming Conventions Use descriptive names for drives, folders, and files Avoid special characters that might cause issues Keep names under 255 characters Use consistent casing Organization Create logical folder structures Use meaningful folder names Implement proper versioning Document your structure Performance Batch operations when possible Use efficient queries Implement caching Consider file sizes Security Use strong passwords for private drives Implement proper key management Follow encryption best practices Regular security audits Error Handling When creating ArFS entities, handle these common scenarios: Transaction Failures Implement retry logic for failed uploads Validate data before uploading Check transaction confirmation status Validation Errors Verify required tags are present Check data format compliance Validate UUID formats Network Issues Implement timeout handling Provide user feedback Graceful degradation Next Steps Now that you know how to create ArFS entities, learn how to work with them: Reading Data - Query and retrieve your ArFS data Privacy & Encryption - Secure your data with private drives Upgrading Private Drives - Update legacy drives to v0.15 How is this guide?GoodBadPrivacy & EncryptionSecure your data with ArFS private drives and encryptionReading DataLearn how to query and retrieve ArFS data from the Arweave network","estimatedWords":748,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:11:13.961Z","breadcrumbs":["build","advanced","arfs","creating drives"],"siteKey":"ario","siteName":"AR-IO Network","depth":4,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:11:13.962Z"},{"url":"https://docs.ar.io/build/advanced/arfs/reading-data","title":"Reading Data","content":"AdvancedArFS ProtocolReading DataCopy MarkdownOpenClients can perform read operations to create a timeline of entity write transactions which can then be replayed to construct the Drive state. This is done by querying an Arweave GraphQL index for the user's respective transactions. Arweave GraphQL Guide can provide more information on how to use Arweave GraphQL. If no GraphQL index is available, drive state can only be generated by downloading and inspecting all transactions made by the user's wallet. This timeline of transactions should be grouped by the block number of each transaction. At every step of the timeline, the client can check if the entity was written by an authorized user. This also conveniently enables the client to surface a trusted entity version history to the user. To determine the owner of a Drive, clients must check for who created the first Drive Entity transaction using that Drive-Id. Until a trusted permissions or ACL system is put in place, any transaction in a drive created by any wallet other than the one who created the first Drive Entity transaction could be considered spam. The Unix-Time defined on each transaction should be reserved for tie-breaking same entity updates in the same block and should not be trusted as the source of truth for entity write ordering. This is unimportant for single owner drives but is crucial for multi-owner drives with updateable permissions (currently undefined in this spec) as a malicious user could fake the Unix-Time to modify the drive timeline for other users. Drives that have been updated many times can have a long entity timeline which can be a performance bottleneck. To avoid this, clients can cache the drive state locally and sync updates to the file system by only querying for entities in blocks higher than the last time they checked. Not checking for Drive Ownership could result in seeing incorrect drive state and GraphQL queries. Folder/File Paths ArweaveFS does not store folder or file paths along with entities as these paths will need to be updated whenever the parent folder name changes which can require many updates for deeply nested file systems. Instead, folder/file paths are left for the client to generate from the folder/file names. Folder View Queries Clients that want to provide users with a quick view of a single folder can simply query for an entity timeline for a particular folder by its id. Clients with multi-owner permissions will additionally have to query for the folder's parent drive entity for permission based filtering of the timeline. Basic Query Patterns Query All Drive Entities query { transactions( tags: [ { name: \"ArFS\", values: [\"0.15\"] } { name: \"Entity-Type\", values: [\"drive\"] } { name: \"Drive-Id\", values: [\"your-drive-id\"] } ] ) { edges { node { id block { height timestamp } tags { name value } } } } } Query Folder Contents query ($parentFolderId: String!) { transactions( tags: [ { name: \"ArFS\", values: [\"0.15\"] } { name: \"Parent-Folder-Id\", values: [$parentFolderId] } ] ) { edges { node { id block { height timestamp } tags { name value } } } } } Query File Entities query ($fileId: String!) { transactions( tags: [ { name: \"ArFS\", values: [\"0.15\"] } { name: \"Entity-Type\", values: [\"file\"] } { name: \"File-Id\", values: [$fileId] } ] ) { edges { node { id block { height timestamp } tags { name value } } } } } Building Drive State The process of building drive state involves several steps: Step-by-Step Process Query for all entities associated with a specific Drive-Id Sort by block height to establish chronological order Process entities bottom-up starting with files and folders Build the hierarchy by following parent-child relationships Handle conflicts by using the most recent entity version Example Implementation async } return driveState; } Using Snapshots For large drives, snapshots can significantly improve performance: Snapshot Query query ($driveId: String!) { transactions( tags: [ { name: \"ArFS\", values: [\"0.15\"] } { name: \"Entity-Type\", values: [\"snapshot\"] } { name: \"Drive-Id\", values: [$driveId] } ] sort: HEIGHT_DESC first: 1 ) { edges { node { id block { height timestamp } tags { name value } } } } } Performance Optimization Caching Strategies Local caching - Store frequently accessed data locally Incremental updates - Only fetch new transactions since last sync Snapshot usage - Use snapshots for large drives Batch queries - Combine multiple queries when possible Query Optimization Use specific tags - Narrow down queries with relevant tags Limit results - Use pagination for large result sets Filter by date - Query specific time ranges Index utilization - Leverage GraphQL indexes effectively Error Handling Common Issues Network timeouts - Implement retry logic Invalid data - Validate entity structure Missing entities - Handle incomplete data gracefully Decryption errors - Proper error handling for private data Best Practices Validate ownership - Check drive ownership before processing Handle conflicts - Resolve entity version conflicts Graceful degradation - Provide fallbacks for missing data User feedback - Inform users of sync status Security Considerations Data Validation Verify signatures - Check transaction signatures Validate ownership - Ensure drive ownership Check timestamps - Validate entity timestamps Sanitize data - Clean user-provided data Privacy Protection Decrypt carefully - Handle private data securely Key management - Protect encryption keys Access control - Implement proper permissions Audit logging - Track data access Next Steps Now that you understand how to read ArFS data, explore these related topics: Privacy & Encryption - Secure your data with private drives Upgrading Private Drives - Update legacy drives to v0.15 Creating Drives - Start building with ArFS How is this guide?GoodBadCreating DrivesLearn how to create ArFS drives, folders, and filesUpgrading Private DrivesLearn how to upgrade legacy private drives to ArFS v0.15","estimatedWords":949,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:11:15.517Z","breadcrumbs":["build","advanced","arfs","reading data"],"siteKey":"ario","siteName":"AR-IO Network","depth":4,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:11:15.517Z"},{"url":"https://docs.ar.io/build/advanced/arfs/upgrading-drives","title":"Upgrading Private Drives","content":"AdvancedArFS ProtocolUpgrading Private DrivesCopy MarkdownOpenOverview Private drives rely on a combination of user-set password and a wallet signature for encryption and decryption. Wander, formerly ArConnect, is a popular Arweave wallet that is deprecating its signature() method in favor of signDataItem() or signMessage(). In order to preserve access to private drive contents that were secured via drive keys created via 'signature()', ArFS v0.15 introduces a new drive key derivation scheme that both utilizes the modern signing APIs and bridges historical drive keys for usage with it. Because private drive entities exist on chain and their encryption cannot be altered, an upgrade is required to allow continued access to \"V1\" private drives. This upgrade essentially takes a signature from the drive owner wallet, encrypts it using the required signature structure for V2 private drives, and places it on Arweave as a new \"Drive-Signature\" entity. This allows the signature to be fetched and decrypted using the latest methods before using it to decrypt the private drive in the V1 format. Deprecation PeriodThe below instructions for upgrading a private drive will work during the deprecation period for the signature() method from Wanter. Once this period is over, and signature() loses all support, additional steps will be required to obtain the correct signature format to decrypt V1 private drives in order to upgrade them.There is, at this time, no set date for when the deprecation period will end. The Upgrade Process The upgrade process involves creating a new Drive-Signature entity that contains an encrypted version of the legacy signature needed to decrypt the private drive. Drive-Signature Entity The Drive-Signature entity stores the encrypted legacy signature: ArFS: \"0.15\", Entity-Type: \"drive-signature\", Signature-Format: \"1\", Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\", Cipher-IV: \"\" {data: } Updated Drive Entity The drive entity is updated with a new Signature-Type tag: ArFS: \"0.15\", Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\", Cipher-IV?: \"\", Content-Type: \"\", Drive-Id: \"\", Drive-Privacy: \"\", Drive-Auth-Mode?: \"password\", Entity-Type: \"drive\", Signature-Type?: \"1\", Unix-Time: \"\" Metadata JSON { \"name\": \"\", \"rootFolderId\": \"\", \"isHidden\": false } Using ArDrive The upgrade process has been made simple by using the ArDrive app. Step 1: Log into ArDrive If the connected wallet has V1 private drives that need to be updated, a banner will appear at the top of the screen. Step 2: Click \"Update Now!\" This will open a modal listing the drives that need to be updated, and linking to more information about the upgrade process. Step 3: Click \"Update\" The process of upgrading the private drives will begin, and involve signing messages depending on how many drives are being upgraded. When the process is complete, a new modal will appear listing the drives that have been successfully updated. Manual Upgrade Process If you need to upgrade drives programmatically, here's the process: 1. Identify V1 Drives Query for drives that don't have the Signature-Type tag: query { transactions( tags: [ { name: \"ArFS\", values: [\"0.15\"] } { name: \"Entity-Type\", values: [\"drive\"] } { name: \"Drive-Privacy\", values: [\"private\"] } ] ) { edges { node { id tags { name value } } } } } 2. Create Drive-Signature Entity async 3. Update Drive Entity async Verification After upgrading, verify the process was successful: Check Drive-Signature Entity query ($driveId: String!) { transactions( tags: [ { name: \"ArFS\", values: [\"0.15\"] } { name: \"Entity-Type\", values: [\"drive-signature\"] } { name: \"Drive-Id\", values: [$driveId] } ] ) { edges { node { id block { height timestamp } tags { name value } } } } } Check Updated Drive Entity query ($driveId: String!) { transactions( tags: [ { name: \"ArFS\", values: [\"0.15\"] } { name: \"Entity-Type\", values: [\"drive\"] } { name: \"Drive-Id\", values: [$driveId] } { name: \"Signature-Type\", values: [\"1\"] } ] ) { edges { node { id block { height timestamp } tags { name value } } } } } Troubleshooting Common Issues Signature not found - Ensure the wallet supports the required signing methods Encryption errors - Verify the encryption parameters are correct Upload failures - Check network connectivity and retry Permission denied - Ensure you own the drive being upgraded Error Handling async catch (error) { console.error(\"Upgrade failed:\", error);","estimatedWords":679,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:11:16.848Z","breadcrumbs":["build","advanced","arfs","upgrading drives"],"siteKey":"ario","siteName":"AR-IO Network","depth":4,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:11:16.848Z"},{"url":"https://docs.ar.io/build/guides/using-turbo-in-a-browser/html","title":"Using Turbo SDK with Vanilla HTML","content":"GuidesUsing Turbo in a BrowserUsing Turbo SDK with Vanilla HTMLCopy MarkdownOpenUsing Turbo SDK with Vanilla HTML Firefox Compatibility: Some compatibility issues have been reported with the Turbo SDK in Firefox browsers.

The standard focuses on simplicity and ease of use in order to encourage broad adoption across the permaweb ecosystem.# MotivationThe goal of the Arweave ecosystem is to create a permanent, collective commons of all valuable knowledge and history, available to all people at any time. Just like the original web, by its open nature this ecosystem encourages wide reuse and copying of data. On the traditional web, this has led to a broad corpus of widely shared information that lacks associated licensing data.By making simple use of the tagging system exposed by Arweave transactions and data entries we can avoid a repeat of this situation, and instead build a web where it is common practice to communicate the license of any piece of data. Due to the inseparable nature of Arweave tags from their associated data, the licensing data of all complying transactions will be atomically communicated to uses -- it is impossible to communicate a link to the data, without also transmitting its licensing information. Due to the nature of Arweave's tagging system, this is achieved without any mandatory or noticeable effect on user experience (when the data is rendered in browsers, etc).# SpecificationThe license tagging format is composed of a single additional tag on any transaction on the Arweave network, as well as two additional transaction formats for defining license types.# Assigning a License to Transaction DataIn order to publish the data of a transaction under a given transaction format, simply add the following tags:Tag NameOptional?Tag ValueLicenseFalseTXID of License DefinitionTitleTrueThe title of the workCreatorTrueThe name/identifier of the creator(s) of the workSourceTrueA link to the source where the material was obtained, if applicable# License AssertionIn order to assert that a previously uploaded transaction has a given license, provide the following tags:Tag NameOptional?Tag ValueApp-NameFalse\"License-Assertion\"OriginalFalseTXID of original uploadLicenseFalseTXID of updated License Definition# License or Legal Tool DefinitionsIn order to define a license or related legal tool (such as CC0open in new window), submit a transaction with the following tags:Tag NameOptional?Tag ValueApp-NameTrue\"License-Definition\"LogoTrueTXID of License LogoShort-NameTrueA short (max 64 characters) 'ticker' with which to refer to the licenseContent-TypeTrueThe MIME type of the contained file, describing the licenseThe body of the transaction must contain the legal text of the license being defined.# License LogosLicense Logo transactions should be defined as follows:Tag NameOptional?Tag ValueContent-TypeFalseThe MIME type of the contained fileThe body of the transaction must contain the visual representation of the license's logo.

Bundled data is a way of writing multiple independent data transactions (referred to as DataItems in this document) into one top level transaction. A DataItem shares many of the same properties as a normal data transaction, in that it has an owner, data, tags, target, signature, and id. It differs in that is has no ability to transfer tokens, and no reward, as the top level transaction pays the reward for all bundled data.# MotivationBundling multiple data transactions into one transaction provides a number of benefits:Allow delegation of payment for a DataItem to a 3rd party, while maintaining the identity and signature of the person who created the DataItem, without them needing to have a wallet with fundsAllow multiple DataItems to be written as a groupIncrease the throughput of logically independent data-writes to the Arweave network# Reference ImplementationThere is a reference implementation for the creation, signing, and verification of DataItems and working with bundles in TypeScriptopen in new window# Specification# 1. Transaction Format# 1.1 Transaction TagsA bundle of DataItems MUST have the following two tags present:Bundle-Format a string describing the bundling format. The format for this standard is binaryBundle-Version a version string. The version referred to in this standard is 2.0.0Version changes may occur due to a change in encoding algorithm in the future# 1.2 Transaction Body FormatThis format for the transaction body is binary data in the following bytes formatN = number of DataItemsBytesPurpose32Numbers of data itemsN x 64Pairs of size and entry ids [size (32 bytes), entry ID (32 bytes)]Remaining bytesBinary encoded data items in bundle# 1.3 DataItem FormatA DataItem is a binary encoded object that has similar properties to a transactionFieldDescriptionEncodingLength (in bytes)Optionalsignature typeType of key format used for the signatureBinary2❌signatureA signature produced by ownerBinaryDepends on signature type❌ownerThe public key of the ownerBinary512❌targetAn address that this DataItem is being sent toBinary32 (+ presence byte)✔️anchorA value to prevent replay attacksBinary32 (+ presence byte)✔️number of tagsNumber of tagsBinary8❌number of tag bytesNumber of bytes used for tagsBinary8❌tagsAn avro array of tag objectsBinaryVariable❌dataThe data contentsBinaryVariable❌All optional fields will have a leading byte which describes whether the field is present (1 for present, 0 for not present). Any other value for this byte makes the DataItem invalid.A tag object is an Apache Avro encoded stream representing an object { name: string, value: string }. Prefixing the tags objects with their bytes length means decoders may skip them if they wish.The anchor and target fields in DataItem are optional. The anchor is an arbitrary value to allow bundling gateways to provide protection from replay attacks against them or their users.# 1.3.1 Tag formatParsing the tags is optional, as they are prefixed by their bytes length.To conform with deployed bundles, the tag format is Apache Avroopen in new window with the following schema:{ \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": { \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"Tag\", \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"name\", \"type\": \"bytes\" }, { \"name\": \"value\", \"type\": \"bytes\" } ] } } Usually the name and value fields are UTF-8 encoded strings, in which case \"string\" may be specified as the field type rather than \"bytes\", and avro will automatically decode them.To encode field and list sizes, avro uses a long datatype that is first zig-zag encoded, and then variable-length integer encoded, using existing encoding specifications. When encoding arrays, avro provides for a streaming approach that separates the content into blocks.# 1.3.1.1 ZigZag codingZigZagopen in new window is an integer format where the sign bit is in the 1s place, such that small negative numbers have no high bits set. In surrounding code, normal integers are almost always stored in a twos-complement manner instead, which can be converted as below.Converting to ZigZag:zigzag = twos_complement > 1; # 1.3.1.2 Variable-length integer codingVariable-length integeropen in new window is a 7-bit little-endian integer format, where the 8th bit of each byte indicates whether another byte (of 7 bits greater significance) follows in the stream.Converting to VInt:// writes 'zigzag' to 'vint' buffer offset = 0; do { vint_byte = zigzag zigzag >>= 7; if (zigzag) vint_byte |= 0x80; vint.writeUInt8(vint_byte, offset); offset += 1; } while(zigzag); Converting from VInt:// constructs 'zigzag' from 'vint' buffer zigzag = 0; offset = 0; do { vint_byte = vint.readUInt8(offset); zigzag |= (vint_byte vint_byte offset += 1; } while(vint_byte); # 1.3.1.3 Avro tag array formatAvro arraysopen in new window may arrive split into more than one sequence of items. Each sequence is prefixed by its length, which may be negative, in which case a byte length is inserted between the length and the sequence content. This is used in schemas of larger data to provide for seeking. The end of the array is indicated by a sequence of length zero.The complete tags format is a single avro array, consisting solely of blocks of the below format. The sequence is terminated by a block with a count of 0. The size field is only present if the count is negative, in which case its absolute value should be used.FieldDescriptionEncodingLengthOptionalcountNumber of items in blockZigZag VIntVariable❌sizeNumber of bytes if count<0ZigZag VIntVariable✔️blockConcatenated tag itemsBinarysize❌# 1.3.1.4 Avro tag item formatEach item of the avro array is a pair of avro strings or bytes objects, a name and a value, each prefixed by their length.FieldDescriptionEncodingLengthOptionalname_sizeNumber of bytes in nameZigZag VIntVariable❌nameName of the tagBinaryname_size❌value_sizeNumber of bytes in valueZigZag VIntVariable❌valueValue of the tagBinaryvalue_size❌# 2. DataItem signature and idThe signature and id for a DataItem is built in a manner similar to Arweave 2.0 transaction signing. It uses the Arweave 2.0 deep-hash algorithm. The 2.0 deep-hash algorithm operates on arbitrarily nested arrays of binary data, i.e a recursive type of DeepHashChunk = Uint8Array | DeepHashChunk[].There are reference implementations for the deep-hash algorithm in TypeScriptopen in new window and Erlangopen in new windowTo generate a valid signature for a DataItem, the contents of the DataItem and static version tags are passed to the deep-hash algorithm to obtain a message. This message is signed by the owner of the DataItem to produce the signature. The id of the DataItem, is the SHA256 digest of this signature.The exact structure and content passed into the deep-hash algorithm to obtain the message to sign is as follows:[ utf8Encoded(\"dataitem\"), utf8Encoded(\"1\"), owner, target, anchor, [ ... [ tag.name, tag.value ], ... [ tag.name, tag.value ], ... ], data ] # 2.1 Verifying a DataItemDataItem verification is a key to maintaining consistency within the bundle standard. A DataItem is valid iff.1:id matches the signature (via SHA-256 of the signature)signature matches the owner's public keytags are all validan anchor isn't more than 32 bytesA tag object is valid iff.:there are <= 128 tagseach key is <= 1024 byteseach value is <= 3072 bytesonly contains a key and valueboth the key and value are non-empty strings# 3. Writing a Bundle of DataItemsTo write a bundle of DataItems, each DataItem should be constructed, signed, encoded, and placed in a transaction with the transaction body format and transaction tags specified in Section 1.# 3.1 Nested bundleArweave Transactions and DataItems have analogous specifications for tagging and bearing of a binary payload. As such, the ANS-104 Bundle Transaction tagging and binary data format specification can be applied to the tags and binary data payload of a DataItem. Assembling a DataItem this way provides for the nesting of ANS-104 Bundles with one-to-many relationships between \"parent\" and \"child\" bundles and theoretically unbounded levels of nesting. Additionally, nested DataItem Bundles can be mixed heterogeneously with non-Bundle DataItems at any depth in the Bundle tree.To construct an ANS-104 DataItem as a nested Bundle:Add tags to the DataItem as described by the specification in section 1.1Provide a binary payload for the DataItem matching the Bundle Transaction Body Format described in section 1.2, i.e. the Bundle header outlining the count, size, and IDs of the subsequent, nested DataItems, each of which should be verifiable using the method described in section 2.1.Gateway GQL queries for DataItem headers should, upon request, contain a bundledIn field whose value indicates the parent-child relationship of the DataItem to its immediate parent. Any nested bundle should be traceable to a base layer Arweave Transaction by recursively following the bundledIn field up through the chain of parents.# 4. Reading a Bundle of DataItemsTo read a bundle of DataItems, the list of bytes representing the DataItems can be partitioned using the offsets in each pair. Subsequently, each partition can be parsed to a DataItem object (struct in languages such as Rust/Go etc. or JSON in TypeScript).This allows for querying of a singleton or a bundle as a whole.# 4.1 Indexing DataItemsThis format allows for indexing of specific fields in O(N) time. Some form of caching or indexing could be performed by gateways to improve lookup times.1 - if and only if ANS-103: Succinct Proofs ANS-105: License Tags","estimatedWords":1473,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:11:38.340Z","breadcrumbs":["tooling","specs","ans","ans 104"],"siteKey":"arweave","siteName":"Arweave Cookbook","depth":4,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:11:38.340Z"},{"url":"https://cookbook.arweave.net/tooling/specs/ans/ANS-103.html","title":"ANS-103 Succinct Proofs of Random Accessopen in new window","content":"Contributors: Dylan ShadeLast Updated: Edit# ANS-103: Succinct Proofs of Random Accessopen in new windowStatus: Draft Authors: Sam Williams sam@arweave.org, Lev Berman ldmberman@protonmail.com# AbstractThis document describes the new consensus mechanism for the Arweave network based on the competition to find a chunk of the past data in a set of historical chunks inferred from the latest agreed-upon blockweave state.# MotivationAt the time when this specification is written, the consensus mechanism employed by the Arweave network is a classical Proof of Work with an additional requirement of including a chunk (up to 256 KiB) of the past data into the hash preimage where the chunk is deterministically determined by the latest state of the blockweave.While this approach incentivizes the network to keep historical data, it does not impose any significant restrictions on the speed of access to data a miner needs to be competitive. Specifically, miners can benefit from using a remote storage pool. Moreover, combined with a computation pool, it can serve Proof of Work preimages to millions of clients per second via a Gbit Internet link. A storage and computation pool has been evidenced in the Arweave network by a decreased number of public nodes and a simultaneous increase of the network hashpower and people claiming to be part of the pool.Therefore, the new consensus algorithm's first goal is to make the mining advantage grow sharply with the growing speed of access to data, promoting replication more aggressively.The second but not less important goal is to reduce the energy consumed by the network. Proof of Work networks are knownopen in new window for their energy-intensity. Reduced energy consumption reduces the carbon footprint, widely believed to be very harmful to the planet. We believe the environment-friendliness of the consensus mechanism is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the Arweave platform.To sum up, the consensus algorithm described here aims at two major goals.Disincentivize miners from retrieving data on demand from the network. In other words, incentivize miners to store data as close to the mining machine as possible.Reduce network's energy consumption.# Reference ImplementationLinkopen in new window.# Specification# PrerequsitesIndexed DatasetThe core of the new mechanism - continuous retrieval of chunks of the past data. Every chunk is identified by a global offset, as we want to make the possession of any byte equally incentivized. Therefore, the whole weave has to be indexed so that every chunk is quickly accessible by its global offset.Starting from the release 2.1, the Arweave Erlang client maintains such an index.Slow HashThe consensus mechanism needs a deterministic but unpredictable way to choose candidate chunks, to make the miners continuously access storage. However, choosing candidate chunks cannot be too easy as it would allow miners to reduce the number of chunks they ever work with. There are two threats associated with that. One threat is the lower cost of the computation expenditure, as compared to the cost of storing extra data required for the same probability of a reward. The second threat is the existing computation technology that, although being more expensive than storing the entire weave, is so efficient that it outperforms even the most efficient data retrieval based client.Starting from release 1.7, the Arweave protocol relies on RandomXopen in new window, a proof-of-work algorithm optimized for general-purpose CPUs.# Algorithm DescriptionEvery block uniquely determines a Search Space - a set of offsets (Recall Bytes) on the [0, weave size at a certain block (Search Space Upper Bound)] interval.# Miner StepsGenerate a random nonce and generate a slow hash (H0) of the hash of a Merkle tree containing the current state, the candidate block, and the nonce.Compute the unique recall byte from H0, the hash of the previous block (PrevH), and Search Space Upper Bound.Search the local storage for the chunk containing the computed Recall Byte. If not found, repeat from the first step.Compute a fast hash of the hash of the Merkle tree containing the slow hash computed at the first step and the located chunk.Check whether the computed hash is bigger than the current mining difficulty (the number computed from its binary digit big-endian representation is bigger). If not, repeat from the first step. If yes, pack and distribute the block (the block contains the nonce and the chunk).The solution chunk together with the Merkle proofs of its inclusion in the blockweave we call Succinct Proof of Random Access (or SPoRA) and use as a name for the new consensus mechanism.# Verifier StepsPerform one iteration over the miner steps where the nonce and the chunk are found in the verified block.# Rationale# Search Space ConstraintsSearch Space needs to be big enough for two reasons:make it prohibitively expensive to download the entire search space on demand; note that the prior consensus mechanism can be viewed as an edge case of SPoRA where the search space consists of a single chunk; the efficiency of serving data to the computing agents on demand depends on the network bandwidth, which grows over timeopen in new window.make it prohibitively expensive to compensate for the lack of data by hashing.On the other hand, Search Space needs to be small enough to incentivize miners to replicate the rarer parts of the weave, which would give them and advantage over miners who replicated less of the corresponding area at the corresponding blocks.We choose the Search Space size to be 10% of the weave. In this case, 10% of the miners storing unique 10% of the weave in the network where everybody stores 90% of the weave are roughly 1.2 times more efficient than the rest of the miners. It holds for various ratios of the time it takes to compute a RandomX hash and the time it takes to look up a chunk.# PseudocodeThe ar_deep_hash definitionopen in new window.mine(Nonce, BlockPreimage, PrevH, SearchSpaceUpperBound): // Compute a slow hash.

We use a slow specialized hardware-resistant hash to make it prohibitively expensive to compensate for the lack of local data with computation.

Bundled data is a way of writing multiple logical data transactions (referred to as DataItems in this document) into one top level transaction. A DataItem shares many of the same properties as normal data transaction, in that it has an owner, data, tags, target, signature, and id. It differs in that it has no ability to transfer tokens, and no reward, as the top level transaction pays the reward for all bundled data.# MotivationBundling multiple logical data transactions into one transaction provides a number of benefits:To allow delegation of payment for a DataItem to a 3rd party, while maintaining the identity and signature of person who created the DataItem, without them needing to have a wallet with funds.Allow multiple DataItems to be written as a group.To increase the throughput of logically independent data writes to the Arweave network# Reference ImplementationThere is a reference implementation for the creation, signing, and verification of DataItems and working with bundles in TypeScriptopen in new window# Specification# 1. Transaction Format# 1.1 Transaction TagsA bundle of DataItems MUST have the following two tags presentBundle-Format a string describing the bundling format. The format for this standard is jsonBundle-Version a version string. The version referred to in this standard is 1.0.0# 1.2 Transaction Body FormatThis format for the transaction body is a JSON object in the following format{ items: [ { DataItem }, { DataItem } ] } # 1.3 DataItem FormatA DataItem is a JSON object that has similar properties to a transaction:B64U Encoding indicates the field is Base64Url encoded binary.All properties MUST be present, for optional values the value in 'Empty Value' MUST be used.FieldDescriptionEncodingEmpty ValueownerThe public key of the ownerB64UtargetAn address that this DataItem is being sent toB64UEmpty StringnonceA value to prevent replay attacksB64UEmpty StringtagsAn array of tag objectsJson ArrayEmpty Json ArraydataThe data contentsB64UsignatureA signature produced by ownerB64UidThe id the itemB64UA tag object is a JSON object with the following two keys. A tag object MUST NOT have any other keys.FieldDescriptionEncodingEmpty ValuenameName of the tagB64UvalueValue of the tagB64UThe fields in the DataItem and Tags objects can be handled in an identical way as their counterpart in a regular Arweave transaction.The nonce field in DataItem is optional, and is an arbitrary value to allow bundling gateways to provide protection from replay attacks against them or their users.# 2. DataItem signature and idThe signature, and id for a DataItem is built in a manner similar to Arweave 2.0 transaction signing. It uses the Arweave 2.0 deep-hash algorithm. The 2.0 deep-hash algorithm operates on arbitrarily nested arrays of binary data, i.e a recursive type of DeepHashChunk = Uint8Array | DeepHashChunk[].There is reference implementations for the deep-hash algorithm in TypeScriptopen in new window and Erlangopen in new windowTo generate a valid signature for a DataItem, the contents of the DataItem and static version tags, are passed to the deep-hash algorithm to obtain a message. This message is signed by the owner of the DataItem to produce the signature. The id of the DataItem, is the SHA256 digest of this signature.The exact structure and content passed into the deep-hash algorithm to obtain the message to sign is as follows:[ utf8Encoded(\"dataitem\"), utf8Encoded(\"1\"), owner, target, nonce, [ ... [ tag.name, tag.value ], ... [ tag.name, tag.value ], ... ], data ] # 3. Expanding a bundle of DataItemsTo read and expand a bundle of DataItems, each DataItem in the items should be verified using the verification algorithm. Individual items that fail verification MUST be discarded.In rare cases, an identical DataItem may exist in more that one transaction. That is, the contents and id of the DataItem are identical but exist in multiple Arweave transactions. Since they are identical, any of the copies can be discarded.# 4. Writing a bundle of DataItemsTo write a bundle of DataItems, each DataItem should constructed and signed, and placed in a transaction with the transaction body format and transaction tags specified in Section 1.

Use one of the GraphQL playgrounds listed above to get started!Copy and paste in the following queryquery { transactions(tags: [{ name: \"App-Name\", values: [\"PublicSquare\"] }]) { edges { node { id tags { name value } } } } } If you’re not familiar with GraphQL it can seem a little overwhelming at first but once you know the structure, it’s fairly easy to read and understand.query { ( ) { } } In the example query we pasted our is transactions but we could also query for blocks. A full description of Arweave's GraphQL schema is written up in the Arweave GraphQL Guideopen in new window. The guide refers to the filter criteria as “Query Structures” and the complete data structure definition of transactions and blocks as “Data Structures”.When it comes to the , the thing to note is that you can specify a subset of the complete data structure you’re interested in. For example, the complete data structure for a transactions schema is listed hereopen in new window.In our case we’re interested in the id and complete list of tags for any transaction matching our filter criteria.Hit the big “Play” button in the middle of the playground to run the query.You’ll notice we get back a list of transactions in the results data structure we specified in our original query.If you’re new to blockchains this is unexpected, we haven’t built anything, why do these results exist? It turns out, the “PublicSquare”: “App-Name” tag we’ve filtered for has been in use for a while.Arweave protocol's founder, Sam Williams, proposed the transaction format a few years ago in a github code snippetopen in new window. Since then builders in the ecosystem have been building on and around it, experimenting, posting transactions with those tags.Back to querying Arweave. You’ll notice in the GraphQL results that there are no readable post messages, just tags and information about posts.This is because the GraphQL indexing service is concerned with indexing and retrieving header data for transactions and blocks but not their associated data.To get the data of a transaction we need to look it up using another HTTP endpoint.https://arweave.net/ Copy and paste one of the id’s in your query results and modify the above link, appending the id. It should look something like this…https://arweave.net/eaUAvulzZPrdh6_cHwUYV473OhvCumqT3K7eWI8tArkThe result of navigating to that URL in the browser (HTTP GET) would be retrieving the content of the post (stored in the transactions data). In this example it’s…Woah that's pretty cool 😎 (For a complete listing arweave HTTP endpoints visit the HTTP APIopen in new window documentation.)# Posting a Query From JavaScriptPosting a GraphQL query from javascript isn't much different than posting it in the playground.First install the arweave-js package for easy access to a GraphQL endpoint.npm install --save arweave Then enter a slightly more advanced version of the example query from above and await the results of posting it.import Arweave from 'arweave'; // initialize an arweave instance const arweave = Arweave.init({}); // create a query that selects tx data the first 100 tx with specific tags const queryObject = { query: `{ transactions( first:100, tags: [ { name: \"App-Name\", values: [\"PublicSquare\"] }, { name: \"Content-Type\", values: [\"text/plain\"] } ] ) { edges { node { id tags { name value } } } } }` }; const results = await arweave.api.post('/graphql', queryObject); # Multiple QueriesIt is possible to post multiple queries in a single round-trip to the GraphQL endpoint. This example queries the name transaction (each as a separate query) for two wallet addresses using the now obsolete (replaced by ar-profile) but still permanent arweave-id protocol.query { account1: transactions(first: 1, owners:[\"89tR0-C1m3_sCWCoVCChg4gFYKdiH5_ZDyZpdJ2DDRw\"], tags: [ { name: \"App-Name\", values: [\"arweave-id\"] }, { name: \"Type\", values: [\"name\"] } ] ) { edges { node { id owner { address } } } } account2: transactions(first: 1, owners:[\"kLx41ALBpTVpCAgymxPaooBgMyk9hsdijSF2T-lZ_Bg\"], tags: [ { name: \"App-Name\", values: [\"arweave-id\"] }, { name: \"Type\", values: [\"name\"] } ] ) { edges { node { id owner { address } } } } } # ResourcesArweave GQL ReferenceArDB packagear-gql packageSearch Indexing Service Goldsky Search Gateway","estimatedWords":839,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:11:44.920Z","breadcrumbs":["tooling","querying arweave"],"siteKey":"arweave","siteName":"Arweave Cookbook","depth":2,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:11:44.920Z"},{"url":"https://cookbook.arweave.net/tooling/graphql/index.html","title":"GraphQL Tools","content":"Contributors: Dylan ShadeLast Updated: Edit# GraphQL ToolsThis section covers the tools and libraries available for querying Arweave data using GraphQL.

This enables:Cost Efficiency: Multiple small transactions can be bundled together, reducing overall transaction costsScalability: Higher throughput by processing many data items in a single base layer transactionFlexibility: Support for different payment tokens while the bundler handles AR token payments# What is a Bundler node?A bundler is a node which is responsible for accepting transactions or data items from users, bundling them, and posting them to the Arweave network (with a guarantee they will be uploaded with a specific transaction ID).# Key Bundling Services:# TurboRepository: Turbo Upload Serviceopen in new windowDescription: A high-performance bundling service developed by ArDriveFeatures: Fast upload processing, reliable data persistence, and efficient bundlingIntegration: Widely used across the Arweave ecosystem for production applications# How Bundlers WorkData Acceptance: Bundlers receive data items from users along with paymentValidation: Each data item is validated for proper formatting and signaturesBundling: Multiple data items are packaged together using ANS-104 standardNetwork Submission: The bundle is submitted to Arweave as a single base layer transactionPersistence Guarantee: Bundlers ensure data is stored until confirmed on-chain# Supporting Multiple CurrenciesA key feature of bundling services is that because they pay for the base Arweave transaction to be posted (using AR tokens) they can choose to enable payments of storage fees on a variety of different tokens. This is the main entry point for other chains to enable Arweave's permanent storage for their users.# Payment Token SupportBundlers can accept various cryptocurrencies for payment while handling the AR token requirements internally:Native AR tokens: Direct payment in Arweave's native currencyEthereum tokens: ETH, USDC, DAI, and other ERC-20 tokensSolana tokens: SOL and SPL tokensOther chains: Support varies by bundler implementation# Benefits for DevelopersSimplified Integration: Developers don't need to manage AR tokens directlyUser Experience: Users can pay with familiar tokens from their preferred chainsCost Predictability: Bundlers often offer fixed pricing in stable currenciesAutomatic Handling: Bundlers manage all Arweave network interactions# Data Verification and IntegrityModern bundling services implement comprehensive verification systems:Signature Verification: All data items must be properly signedData Root Verification: Bundle contents are cryptographically verified against Arweave chain dataBackground Verification: Continuous validation ensures data integrity over timeChunk-based Retrieval: Data can be retrieved and verified through Arweave's chunk system# Code Examples# Using Turbo SDK# Basic Upload with TurboBasic Upload Exampleimport { TurboFactory, ArweaveSigner } from '@ardrive/turbo-sdk';

It serves as a decentralized operating system, powering the AO Computer—a scalable, trust-minimized, distributed supercomputer built on the permanent storage of Arweave.For the most current technical specifications and implementation details, refer to the official HyperBEAM documentationopen in new window.# What is HyperBEAM?Think of HyperBEAM as your \"Swiss Army knife\" for decentralized development. It's not a single-purpose application, but rather a powerful, extensible engine that transforms the abstract concepts of AO-Core into a concrete, operational system.HyperBEAM provides the runtime environment and essential services to execute computations across a network of distributed nodes, making the AO Computer accessible through familiar web technologies like HTTP.HyperBEAM serves as the bridge between standard HTTP interfaces and the AO Computer, managing message routing, device execution, state queries, and cryptographic verification.# Core AO-Core Concepts in HyperBEAMHyperBEAM implements the three fundamental components of AO-Core:# Messages: Modular Data PacketsIn HyperBEAM, every interaction within the AO Computer is handled as a message. Messages are cryptographically-linked data units that form the foundation for communication, allowing processes to trigger computations, query state, and transfer value.// Example message structure in HyperBEAM const message = { Id: \"MESSAGE_TX_ID\", Process: \"TARGET_PROCESS_ID\", Owner: \"SENDER_ADDRESS\", Data: \"Hello, AO Computer!\", Tags: [ { name: \"Action\", value: \"Greet\" }, { name: \"Device\", value: \"~lua@5.3a\" } ] }; HyperBEAM nodes are responsible for routing and processing these messages according to the rules of the AO-Core protocol, ensuring reliable delivery and execution.# Devices: Extensible Execution EnginesHyperBEAM introduces a uniquely modular architecture centered around Devices. These pluggable components are Erlang modules that define specific computational logic—like running WASM, managing state, or relaying data—allowing for unprecedented flexibility.Common HyperBEAM Devices:~process@1.0: Manages persistent, shared computational states (like smart contracts)~lua@5.3a: Executes Lua scripts for serverless functions~wasm64@1.0: Executes WebAssembly code for high-performance computing~json@1.0: Provides JSON data structure manipulation~relay@1.0: Forwards messages between nodes or external HTTP endpoints~scheduler@1.0: Handles message ordering and execution timingFor a complete list of devices and their latest specifications, see the HyperBEAM Devices documentationopen in new window.# Using the Lua device to execute a calculation GET /~lua@5.3a _ -> {error, unknown_action, State} end. # Hardware AbstractionHyperBEAM abstracts away underlying hardware differences, allowing diverse nodes to contribute resources without compatibility issues.

Users can register a name within the ArNS Registry, like \"my-name\" and set a pointer to any Arweave Transaction ID.AR.IO Gateways will resolve that name as one of their own subdomains, eg. https://laserilla.arweave.net and proxy all requests to the associated Arweave Transaction ID. Each registered name can also have under names associated with it that each point to an Arweave Transaction ID, like https://v1_laserilla.arweave.net, giving even more flexibility and control to its owner.# The ArNS RegistryArNS uses AO to manage its name records. Each record, or name, is leased by a user or bought permanently and tied to an ANT token. You can register multiple ArNS names to a single ANT, but you cannot register multiple ANTs to a single ArNS name - the gateways wouldn't know where to point the routing ID.ArNS names can be up to 32 characters, including numbers [0-9], letters [a-z], and dashes [-]. The dashes cannot be trailing dashes, e.g. -myname.# ANTs (Arweave Name Tokens)ANTs are a crucial part of the ArNS ecosystem - they are the actual key to owning an ArNS name. When you register an ArNS name to an ANT, the ANT then becomes the transfer method for that name. The ArNS registry does not care who owns the ANT, it simply knows what name ANT it belongs to.Within ANTs you can build out whatever functionality you wish, within the scope ArNS registry approved source code transaction list.# Under_NamesUndernames are records held and managed by your ANT (Arweave Name Token). These records can be created and managed without even owning an ARNS name, and will be transferred along with the ant when sent to a new owner. Likewise if your ArNS name expires, and you register your ANT to a new ArNS name, all your undername will remain intact.Example: you own oldName.arweave.net.then: You create the undername \"my\" - my_oldName.arweave.net.then: oldName.arweave.net expires, and you register newName.arweave.net to your ANT.now: my_ undername is accessable on newName - my_newName.arweave.net.Below is an example of an ANT contract State:{ balances:{ QGWqtJdLLgm2ehFWiiPzMaoFLD50CnGuzZIPEdoDRGQ : 1 }, controller: \"QGWqtJdLLgm2ehFWiiPzMaoFLD50CnGuzZIPEdoDRGQ\", evolve: null, name: \"ArDrive OG Logo\", owner: \"QGWqtJdLLgm2ehFWiiPzMaoFLD50CnGuzZIPEdoDRGQ\", records:{ @:{ transactionId: \"xWQ7UmbP0ZHDY7OLCxJsuPCN3wSUk0jCTJvOG1etCRo\" }, undername1:{ transactionId: \"usOLUmbP0ZHDY7OLCxJsuPCN3wSUk0jkdlvOG1etCRo\" } }, ticker:\"ANT-ARDRIVE-OG-LOGO\" } the base \"@\" record is the initial routing id for the ANT. if you registered 'my-name' to this ANT, and tried to access it via my-name.arweave.net, you would be redirected to the @ record's transactionId.if you tried to access undername1_my-name.arweave.net, you would get 'undername1's transactionId.ANT's, in theory, have an UNLIMITED number of undernames. However, how many will be served depends on which tier is used with your ArNS name.# ResourcesArNS Appopen in new windowArNS Docsopen in new window Manifests & Path Resolution","estimatedWords":536,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:11:58.265Z","breadcrumbs":["fundamentals","accessing arweave data","arns"],"siteKey":"arweave","siteName":"Arweave Cookbook","depth":3,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:11:58.265Z"},{"url":"https://cookbook.arweave.net/fundamentals/accessing-arweave-data/manifests.html","title":"Path Manifests","content":"Contributors: Dylan ShadeLast Updated: Edit# Path Manifests# OverviewWhen uploading files to Arweave each file is assigned its own unique transaction ID.

An indexing service reads transaction and block headers as they are added to the network (usually from a full Arweave node which the service operates). Once read, the header info is inserted into a database where it can be indexed and efficiently queried. The indexing service uses this database to provide a GraphQL endpoint for clients to query.GraphQL has a few advantages that make it ideal for retrieving query data sets. It enables indexing services to create a single endpoint that can then be used to query all types data. The service is able to return multiple resources in a single request as opposed to making an HTTP request for each resource (like one would with a REST API). With GraphQL, clients can batch multiple requests in a single round-trip and specify exactly what data is needed which increases performance.# Basic Query ExampleThe following GraphQL example queries all the transaction ids from a given owners wallet address that have a \"Type\" tag with a value of \"manifest\".

It enables multiple other transactions and/or data items to be bundled inside it. Because transaction bundles contain many nested transactions they are key to Arweave's ability to scale to thousands of transactions per second.Users submit transactions to a bundling service, such as turboopen in new window, which combines them into a 'bundle' with other transactions and posts them to the network.# How Do Bundles Help Arweave?# AvailabilityBundling services guarantee that bundled transactions are reliably posted to Arweave without dropping.Transaction IDs of the bundled transactions are immediately made available, meaning the data can instantly be accessed as if it was already on the Arweave network.# ReliabilityTransactions posted to Arweave can occasionally fail to confirm (resulting in a dropped transaction) due to a number of reasons, such as high network activity. In these instances transactions can become orphaned, i.e. stuck in the mempool and eventually removed.Bundlers solve this problem by continually attempting to post bundled data to Arweave, assuring that it does not fail or get stuck in the mempool.# ScalabilityBundles can store up to 2256 transactions, each of which are settled as a single transaction on Arweave. This makes Arweave blockspace scale to support almost any use case.# What are Nested Bundles?Bundles can include data items for uploading to Arweave and those data item can themselves be a bundle.This means it is possible to upload a bundle of bundles, or in other words nested bundles.Nested bundles have no theoretical limit on nesting depth, meaning that transaction throughput can be increased drastically.Nested bundles might be useful for when you have different groups of bundled data that you want to guarantee reach Arweave altogether, and at the same time.Sources and Further Reading:Ardrive Turboopen in new windowANS-104 Standardopen in new window Metadata (Tags)","estimatedWords":309,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:12:00.710Z","breadcrumbs":["fundamentals","transactions","bundles"],"siteKey":"arweave","siteName":"Arweave Cookbook","depth":3,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:12:00.711Z"},{"url":"https://cookbook.arweave.net/fundamentals/transactions/tags.html","title":"Transaction Metadata (Tags)","content":"Contributors: Dylan ShadeLast Updated: Edit# Transaction Metadata (Tags)Arweave can be thought of as a permanent append-only hard drive where each entry on the drive is its own unique transaction. Transactions have a unique ID, signature, and owner address for the address that signed and paid for the transaction to be posted. Along with those header values, the Arweave protocol allows users to tag transactions with custom tags. These are specified as a collection name value pairs appended to the transaction. These tags make it possible to query Arweave and find all the Transactions that include a particular tag or tags. The ability to query and filter transactions is critical to supporting apps built on Arweave.# What are Transaction Tags?Transaction tags are key-value pairs, where the combination of base64URL keys and values must be less than the maximum of 2048 bytes for an arweave native transaction.Some common examples of transaction tags include:Content-Type: Used to specify the MIME type of content for render on the permaweb.App-Name: This tag describes the app that is writing the dataApp-Version: This tag is the version of the app, paired with App-NameUnix-Time: This tag is the a unix timestamp, seconds since epoch.Title: Used to give a name or brief description of the content stored in the transaction.Description: Used to provide a longer description of the content.Transaction tags can be used for a variety of purposes, such as indexing transactions for search, organizing transactions into categories, or providing metadata about the content stored in a transaction.# Some good things to know about Transaction TagsTransaction tags are encoded as Base64URL encoded strings for both the key and value. This makes it possible to post arrays of bytes as keys or values and transfer them safely over http. While it's not human readable without decoding, it shouldn't be considered encryption.The max total size of Transaction tags for transaction posted directly to Arweave is 2048 bytes. This size is determined by the concatenation of all keys and all values of the transaction tags.Transaction tags can be used in GraphQL queries to return a filtered set of transaction items.# Common Tags used in the communityTag NameDescriptionUse CasesApp-NameMost commonly used to identify applications using ArweaveCommon uses are the project's name, sometimes also used in specific ANS transactionsApp-VersionThe version of this data, it may represent the app consuming this informationE.g. 0.3.0Content-TypeMIME Type to identify the data contained in the transactiontext/html, application/json, image/pngUnix-TimeThis tag is the a unix timestamp, seconds since epochThe time the transaction is submittedTitleANS-110 Standard for describing contentProviding a name for an Atomic AssetTypeANS-110 Standard for categorization of dataa type can classify a permaweb asset# Examplesconst tx = await arweave.createTransaction({ data: mydata }); tx.addTag(\"Content-Type\", \"text/html\"); tx.addTag(\"Title\", \"My incredible post about Transaction Tags\"); tx.addTag(\"Description\", \"This is one post you do not want to miss!\"); tx.addTag(\"Topic:Amazing\", \"Amazing\"); tx.addTag(\"Type\", \"blog-post\"); await arweave.transactions.sign(tx, jwk); await arweave.transactions.post(tx); # SummaryUnderstanding how Transaction Tags factor into the Arweave tech stack can provide context on how to solve problems using the Permaweb as an application platform.

Each has its own unique affordances and constraints. The diagram below illustrates the four main approaches to posting transactions.Direct to Peer,Direct to Gateway, Bundled, and Dispatched.Guaranteed TransactionsWhen posting a large quantity of transactions or when fast settlement time is desireable consider using a bundling service. Bundlers settle large volumes of transactions immediately and make the transaction data available within milliseconds. The bundling service holds onto posted transactions until they are confirmed on-chain. If the transactions are not included in the most recent block the bundling service re-posts them with each new block until they are recorded on chain with a sufficient number of confirmations.# Direct TransactionsTransactions posted directly to Arweave come in two varieties wallet-to-wallet transactions and data transactions. The first transfers AR tokens between wallet addresses. The second posts data to Arweave and pays the associated storage costs.Interestingly, data transactions may also transfer AR tokens to a wallet address while paying storage costs at the same time.All transactions allow the user to specify up to 2KB worth of metadata in the form of custom tags.# Direct to PeerTransactions may be posted directly to an Arweave peer (mining node). This is perhaps the most decentralized means of posting a transaction as clients can choose what peer they wish to post to.This approach is not without drawbacks. Peers may come and go making it difficult to reliably post transactions from an app. While it's possible to query a list of active peers and choose one before posting it adds overhead and friction to the process. Additionally, transactions posted to peers are only queryable at the gateway after being mined in a block. This introduces a 1-2 minute delay between posting the transaction to a peer and it being available to read in a browser from a gateway.For the above reasons, developers tend to configure arweave-js to point to a gateway when posting direct transactions as the optimistic cache at the gateway makes the transaction available almost immediately.# Direct to GatewayGateways sit between clients and Arweave's network of peers. One of the primary functions of the gateway is to index transactions and optimistically cache the data posted to the network while waiting for it to be included in a block. This makes the transaction queryable in a \"Pending\" state almost instantly which allows applications built on top of a gateway to be more responsive. There is still a risk of transactions dropping out of the optimistic cache if they are not mined in a block by the peers.An example of how to post a direct transaction using arweave-js can be found in this guide.# Bundled TransactionsServices built on top of Arweave that provide additional utility for Permaweb builders are sometimes called Permaweb Services. A bundler is one such service. Bundlers take multiple individual transactions and bundle them together into a single transaction that is posted directly to Arweave. In this way a single transaction at the protocol level can contain tens of thousands of bundled transactions. There is one restriction, however, only data transactions can be included in a bundle. Wallet-to-wallet transactions (that transfer AR tokens between wallet addresses) must be done as individual transactions posted directly to Arweave.# Dispatched TransactionsAnother way to post bundled transactions is from the browser. While browsers enforce some constraints around the size of data that can be uploaded, browser based wallets are able to post transactions to bundlers. Arweave browser wallets implement a dispatch() API method. If you are posting small transactions (100KB or less) you can use the wallets dispatch() method to take advantage of bundled transactions.An example of how to post a 100KB or less bundled transaction with an Arweave wallets dispatch() method can be found in this guide.# Resourcesarweave-js exampledispatch exampleTurbo SDK example Metadata (Tags)","estimatedWords":637,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:12:02.529Z","breadcrumbs":["fundamentals","transactions","post transactions"],"siteKey":"arweave","siteName":"Arweave Cookbook","depth":3,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:12:02.529Z"},{"url":"https://cookbook.arweave.net/fundamentals/transactions/transaction-types.html","title":"Transactions","content":"Contributors: Dylan ShadeLast Updated: Edit# TransactionsTransactions are the fundamental building blocks of the Arweave network.

This means that once data is uploaded to the Permaweb, it cannot be deleted or altered. This can be beneficial for applications that require tamper-proof data storage, such as supply chain management or voting systems.Another difference is that the Permaweb is decentralized, meaning there is no central point of control or failure. This can provide increased security and reliability for applications.Additionally, the Permaweb uses a unique token, called AR, to pay for the storage of data on the network. This can add a new layer of complexity to application development, as developers need to consider how to integrate AR into their applications and handle payments.Overall, the experience of creating applications on the Permaweb can be challenging, but it can also be rewarding as it offers unique benefits over traditional web development.# Hello WorldsHello World (No Code)Hello World (CLI)","estimatedWords":196,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:12:08.092Z","breadcrumbs":["getting started","welcome"],"siteKey":"arweave","siteName":"Arweave Cookbook","depth":2,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:12:08.092Z"},{"url":"https://cookbook.arweave.net/index.html","title":"Build on the Permaweb","content":"Contributors: Dylan ShadeLast Updated: Edit# Cooking with the PermawebThe Permaweb Cookbook is a developer resource that provides the essential concepts and references for buiding applications on the Permaweb.

Files are stored as individual transactions on the Arweave blockchain, while folders are metadata that reference these file transactions.# MetadataEach file and folder has associated metadata, such as the name, type, size, and modification timestamp. ArFS leverages Arweave's tagging system to store this metadata in a standardized format, which allows for easy querying and organization.# File PermissionsArFS supports public and private file permissions. Public files can be accessed by anyone on the network, while private files are encrypted using the owner's private key, ensuring only they can decrypt and access the content.# File VersioningArFS supports versioning of files, allowing users to store multiple versions of a file and access previous versions at any time. This is achieved by linking new file transactions to previous versions through the use of metadata tags.# Data DeduplicationTo minimize storage redundancy and costs, ArFS employs data deduplication techniques. If a user tries to store a file that already exists on the network, the protocol will simply create a new reference to the existing file instead of storing a duplicate copy.# Search and DiscoveryArFS enables users to search and discover files based on their metadata, such as file names, types, and tags. This is made possible by indexing the metadata stored within the Arweave blockchain.# InteroperabilityArFS is designed to be interoperable with other decentralized applications and services built on the Arweave network. This allows for seamless integration and collaboration between different applications and users.# Getting StartedTo start using ArFS, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the Arweave ecosystem, acquire AR tokens to cover storage costs, and choose a compatible client or library to interact with the ArFS protocol.# ResourcesFor more information, documentation, and community support, refer to the following resources:Arweave Official Websiteopen in new windowArweave Developer Documentationopen in new windowArweave Community Forumsopen in new window Data Model","estimatedWords":423,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:12:12.044Z","breadcrumbs":["tooling","specs","arfs","arfs"],"siteKey":"arweave","siteName":"Arweave Cookbook","depth":4,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:12:12.044Z"},{"url":"https://cookbook.arweave.net/tooling/specs/arfs/data-model.html","title":"Data Model","content":"Contributors: Dylan ShadeLast Updated: Edit# Data ModelBecause of Arweave's permanent and immutable nature, traditional file structure operations such as renaming and moving files or folders cannot be accomplished by simply updating on-chain data.

Each file contains metadata that refers to the parent folder, and each folder contains metadata that refers to its parent drive.

More detailed information about each Entity Type can be found here.Entity Relationship DiagramAs you can see, each file and folder contains metadata which points to both the parent folder and the parent drive.

In the case of private entities, JSON data and file data payloads are always encrypted according to the protocol processes defined below.Drive entities require a single metadata transaction, with standard Drive tags and encoded JSON with secondary metadata.Folder entities require a single metadata transaction, with standard Folder tags and an encoded JSON with secondary metadata.File entities require a metadata transaction, with standard File tags and an encoded Data JSON with secondary metadata relating to the file.File entities also require a second data transaction, which includes a limited set of File tags and the actual file data itself.Snapshot entities require a single transaction. which contains a Data JSON with all of the Drive’s rolled up ArFS metadata and standard Snapshot GQL tags that identify the Snapshot.# DriveA drive is the highest level logical grouping of folders and files. All folders and files must be part of a drive, and reference the Drive ID of that drive.When creating a Drive, a corresponding folder must be created as well. This will act as the root folder of the drive. This separation of drive and folder entity enables features such as folder view queries, renaming, and linking.ArFS: \"0.13\" Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\" Cipher-IV?: \"\" Content-Type: \"\" Drive-Id: \"\" Drive-Privacy: \"\" Drive-Auth-Mode?: \"password\" Entity-Type: \"drive\" Unix-Time: \"\" Data JSON { \"name\": \"\", \"rootFolderId\": \"\" } Drive Entity Transaction Example# FolderA folder is a logical grouping of other folders and files.

Instead, the File data must be uploaded as a separate transaction, called the File Data Transaction. The File JSON metadata transaction contains a reference to the File Data Transaction ID so that it can retrieve the actual data. This separation allows for file metadata to be updated without requiring the file itself to be reuploaded. It also ensures that private files can have their JSON Metadata Transaction encrypted as well, ensuring that no one without authorization can see either the file or its metadata.ArFS: \"0.13\" Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\" Cipher-IV?: \"\" Content-Type: \"\" Drive-Id: \"\" Entity-Type: \"file\" File-Id: \"\" Parent-Folder-Id: \"\" Unix-Time: \"\" Data JSON { \"name\": \"\", \"size\": \"\", \"lastModifiedDate\": \"\", \"dataTxId\": \"\", \"dataContentType\": \"\", \"pinnedDataOwner\": \"\" # Optional } Pin Files Since the version v0.13, ArFS suports Pins. Pins are files whose data may be any transaction uploaded to Arweave, that may or may not be owned by the wallet that created the pin.When a new File Pin is created, the only created transaction is the Metadata Transaction. The dataTxId field will point it to any transaction in Arweave, and the optional pinnedDataOwner field is gonna hold the address of the wallet that owns the original copy of the data transaction.File Data Transaction ExampleThe File Data Transaction contains limited information about the file, such as the information required to decrypt it, or the Content-Type (mime-type) needed to view in the browser.Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\" Cipher-IV?: \"\" Content-Type: \"\" { File Data - Encrypted if private } File Metadata Transaction ExampleThe the File Metadata Transaction contains the GQL Tags necessary to identify the file within a drive and folder.Its data contains the JSON metadata for the file. This includes the file name, size, last modified date, data transaction id, and data content type.ArFS: \"0.13\" Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\" Cipher-IV?: \"\" Content-Type: \"\" Drive-Id: \"\" Entity-Type: \"file\" File-Id: \"\" Parent-Folder-Id: \"\" Unix-Time: \"\" { File JSON Metadata - Encrypted if private } # SnapshotArFS applications generate the latest state of a drive by querying for all ArFS transactions made relating to a user's particular Drive-Id. This includes both paged queries for indexed ArFS data via GQL, as well as the ArFS JSON metadata entries for each ArFS transaction.For small drives (less than 1000 files), a few thousand requests for very small volumes of data can be achieved relatively quickly and reliably. For larger drives, however, this results in long sync times to pull every piece of ArFS metadata when the local database cache is empty. This can also potentially trigger rate-limiting related ArWeave Gateway delays.Once a drive state has been completely, and accurately generated, in can be rolled up into a single snapshot and uploaded as an Arweave transaction. ArFS clients can use GQL to find and retrieve this snapshot in order to rapidly reconstitute the total state of the drive, or a large portion of it. They can then query individual transactions performed after the snapshot.This optional method offers convenience and resource efficiency when building the drive state, at the cost of paying for uploading the snapshot data. Using this method means a client will only have to iterate through a few snapshots instead of every transaction performed on the drive.# Snapshot Entity TagsSnapshot entities require the following tags. These are queried by ArFS clients to find drive snapshots, organize them together with any other transactions not included within them, and build the latest state of the drive.ArFS: \"0.13\" Drive-Id: \"\" Entity-Type: \"snapshot\" Snapshot-Id: \"\" Content-Type: \"\" Block-Start: \"\" Block-End: \"\" Data-Start: \"\" Snapshot Transaction GQL tags example# Snapshot Entity DataA JSON data object must also be uploaded with every ArFS Snapshot entity. THis data contains all ArFS Drive, Folder, and File metadata changes within the associated drive, as well as any previous Snapshots. The Snapshot Data contains an array txSnapshots. Each item includes both the GQL and ArFS metadata details of each transaction made for the associated drive, within the snapshot's start and end period.A tsSnapshot contains a gqlNode object which uses the same GQL tags interface returned by the Arweave Gateway. It includes all of the important block, owner, tags, and bundledIn information needed by ArFS clients. It also contains a dataJson object which stores the correlated Data JSON for that ArFS entity.For private drives, the dataJson object contains the JSON-string-escaped encrypted text of the associated file or folder. This encrypted text uses the file's existing Cipher and Cipher-IV. This ensures clients can decrypt this information quickly using the existing ArFS privacy protocols.{ \"txSnapshots\": [ { \"gqlNode\": { \"id\": \"bWCvIc3cOzwVgquD349HUVsn5Dd1_GIri8Dglok41Vg\", \"owner\": { \"address\": \"hlWRbyJ6WUoErm3b0wqVgd1l3LTgaQeLBhB36v2HxgY\" }, \"bundledIn\": { \"id\": \"39n5evzP1Ip9MhGytuFm7F3TDaozwHuVUbS55My-MBk\" }, \"block\": { \"height\": 1062005, \"timestamp\": 1669053791 }, \"tags\": [ { \"name\": \"Content-Type\", \"value\": \"application/json\" }, { \"name\": \"ArFS\", \"value\": \"0.11\" }, { \"name\": \"Entity-Type\", \"value\": \"drive\" }, { \"name\": \"Drive-Id\", \"value\": \"f27abc4b-ed6f-4108-a9f5-e545fc4ff55b\" }, { \"name\": \"Drive-Privacy\", \"value\": \"public\" }, { \"name\": \"App-Name\", \"value\": \"ArDrive-App\" }, { \"name\": \"App-Platform\", \"value\": \"Web\" }, { \"name\": \"App-Version\", \"value\": \"1.39.0\" }, { \"name\": \"Unix-Time\", \"value\": \"1669053323\" } ] }, \"dataJson\": \"{\\\"name\\\":\\\"november\\\",\\\"rootFolderId\\\":\\\"71dfc1cb-5368-4323-972a-e9dd0b1c63a0\\\"}\" } ] } Snapshot Transaction JSON data example# Schema DiagramsThe following diagrams show complete examples of Drive, Folder, and File entity Schemas.# Public DrivePublic Drive Schema# Private DrivePrivate Drive Schema Data Model Content Types","estimatedWords":1263,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:12:13.597Z","breadcrumbs":["tooling","specs","arfs","entity types"],"siteKey":"arweave","siteName":"Arweave Cookbook","depth":4,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:12:13.597Z"},{"url":"https://cookbook.arweave.net/tooling/specs/arfs/content-types.html","title":"Content Types","content":"Contributors: Dylan ShadeLast Updated: Edit# Content TypesAll transaction types in ArFS leverage a specific metadata tag for the Content-Type (also known as mime-type) of the data that is included in the transaction.

But with apps that use ArFS, like ArDrive, your private data never leaves your computer without using military grade (and quantum resistantopen in new window) encryption. This privacy layer is applied at the Drive level, and users determine whether a Drive is public or private when they first create it. Private drives must follow the ArFS privacy model.Every file within a Private Drive is symmetrically encrypted using AES-256-GCMopen in new window. Every Private drive has a master \"Drive Key\" which uses a combination of the user's Arweave wallet signature, a user defined drive password, and a unique drive identifier (uuidv4open in new window). Each file has its own \"File Key\" derived from the \"Drive Key\". This allows for single files to be shared without exposing access to the other files within the Drive.Once a file is encrypted and stored on Arweave, it is locked forever and can only be decrypted using its file key.# Deriving KeysPrivate drives have a global drive key, D, and multiple file keys F, for encryption. This enables a drive to have as many uniquely encrypted files as needed. One key is used for all versions of a single file (since new file versions use the same File-Id)D is used for encrypting both Drive and Folder metadata, while F is used for encrypting File metadata and the actual stored data. Having these different keys, D and F, allows a user to share specific files without revealing the contents of their entire drive.D is derived using HKDF-SHA256 with an unsaltedopen in new window RSA-PSS signature of the drive's id and a user provided password.F is also derived using HKDF-SHA256 with the drive key and the file's id.Other wallets (like Wanderopen in new window) integrate with this Key Derivation protocol just exposing an API to collect a signature from a given Arweave Wallet in order to get the SHA-256 signature needed for the HKDFopen in new window to derive the Drive Key.An example implementation, using Dart, is available hereopen in new window, with a Typescript implementation hereopen in new window.# Private DrivesDrives can store either public or private data. This is indicated by the Drive-Privacy tag in the Drive entity metadata.Drive-Privacy: \"\" If a Drive entity is private, an additional tag Drive-Auth-Mode must also be used to indicate how the Drive Key is derived. ArDrive clients currently leverage a secure password along with the Arweave Wallet private key signature to derive the global Drive Key.Drive-Auth-Mode?: 'password' On every encrypted Drive Entity, a Cipher tag must be specified, along with the public parameters for decrypting the data. This is done by specifying the parameter with a Cipher-* tag. eg. Cipher-IV. If the parameter is byte data, it must be encoded as Base64 in the tag.ArDrive clients currently leverage AES256-GCM for all symmetric encryption, which requires a Cipher Initialization Vector consisting of 12 random bytes.Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\" Cipher-IV?: \"\" Additionally, all encrypted transactions must have the Content-Type tag application/octet-stream as opposed to application/jsonPrivate Drive Entities and their corresponding Root Folder Entities will both use these keys and ciphers generated to symmetrically encrypt the JSON files that are included in the transaction. This ensures that only the Drive Owner (and whomever the keys have been shared with) can open the drive, discover the root folder, and continue to load the rest of the children in the drive.# Private FilesWhen a file is uploaded to a private drive, it by default also becomes private and leverages the same drive keys used for its parent drive. Each unique file in a drive will get its own set of file keys based off of that file's unique FileId. If a single file gets a new version, its File-Id will be reused, effectively leveraging the same File Key for all versions in that file's history.These file keys can be shared by the drive's owner as needed.Private File entities have both its metadata and data transactions encrypted using the same File Key, ensuring all facets of the data is truly private. As such, both the file's metadata and data transactions must both have a unique Cipher-IV and Cipher tag:Cipher?: \"AES256-GCM\" Cipher-IV?: \"\" Just like drives, private files must have the Content-Type tag set as application/octet-stream in both its metadata and data transactions:Content-Type: \"application/octet-stream\" Content Types schema-diagrams.md","estimatedWords":720,"lastModified":"2025-10-25T12:12:14.801Z","breadcrumbs":["tooling","specs","arfs","privacy"],"siteKey":"arweave","siteName":"Arweave Cookbook","depth":4,"crawledAt":"2025-10-25T12:12:14.801Z"},{"url":"https://cookbook.arweave.net/tooling/specs/arfs/schema-diagrams.html","title":"Cooking with the Permaweb","content":"Contributors: Dylan ShadeLast Updated: Edit# Schema DiagramsThe following diagrams show complete examples of Drive, Folder, and File entity Schemas.# Public DrivePublic Drive Schema# Private DrivePrivate Drive SchemaArweave GQL Tag Byte Limit is restricted to 2048.

You'll also need a random seed generation function, since message IDs are deterministic content hashes and it generates the same message ID if you send the same initialization message. To avoid this, you need to include a randomized value in the message content to spawn a new process. Also you need to nest the message in body without specifying path in the inner message.

You already know the fundamentals of how HyperBEAM works. Chaining Device Methods with URL Path Let's play around with device composition to build something powerful. We can access any cached messages with an ID or a hashpath at /[id | hashpath]. And we can also chain device methods like /~meta@1.0/info/~json@1.0/serialize. Could we chain our own device methods like the following? /[hashpath]/~mydev@1.0/inc/~mydev@1.0/double/~mydev@1.0/square Let's find out! Our goal is to pass an existing message with num, and compute num through the device method chaining. So if the initial message with a hashpath has num=6, => /~mydev@1.0/inc => 6 + 1 => num=7 => /~mydev@1.0/double => 7 * 2 => num=14 => /~mydev@1.0/square => 14 * 14 => num=196 is what we need to end up with.

It works! But there are 3 caveats to this. First of all, during this pipeline, the Msg2 passed to each device method of inc/3, double/3, and square/3 stays the same and is the original committed Msg2 to the first method in the chain, which in this case is deviceless since we start the pipeline with /${out.hashpath_7}. If we were to start the chain with /~mydev@1.0/inc/~mydev@1.0/double/~mydev@1.0/square, the Msg2 would always be the same as what is passed to /~mydev@1.0/inc. So to evolve the state, you need to use the values from Msg1. Secondly, as we learned in an earlier chapter, Msg1 contains inter-decoded values, and not the final decoded values, which means even if you pass integer, Msg1 will have stringified num. You need to take the initial values from Msg2. Lastly, during the pipeline, you cannot overwrite the fields initially passed to Msg2. So you cannot pass num and update num during the pipeline. The initial Msg2 always overwrites the updated num and it ends up unchanged. So you need to pass something other than num, then update num during the pipeline. The case with /[hashpath]/~mydev@1.0/inc/~mydev@1.0/double/~mydev@1.0/square works since we're not passing num to the initial /[hashpath] execution. One way to solve this is to create an entry method like calc to take a different field such as init_num from Msg2, then pass it down to the pipeline as num. File/HyperBEAM/src/dev_mydev.erlCopy-export([ calc/3 ]). calc(Msg1, Msg2, Opts)-> Num = maps:get(>, Msg2), {ok, #{ > => Num}}. Now we can POST to /~mydev@1.0/calc/~mydev@1.0/inc/~mydev@1.0/double/~mydev@1.0/square, and get the correct output. File/test/device-composition.test.jsCopyconst { num } = await hb.p( \"/~mydev@1.0/calc/~mydev@1.0/inc/~mydev@1.0/double/~mydev@1.0/square\", { init_num: 1 } ) assert.equal(num, 16) Stacking Devices There is a built-in device called stack@1.0 to make device composition easy. It's supposed to be used with process@1.0, so it's limited in a certain way, but we can still use it without processes. Let's modify our methods to make them compatible with stack@1.0. We just need to forward device-stack from Msg1. File/HyperBEAM/src/dev_mydev.erlCopy-export([ inc2/3, double2/3, square2/3 ]). inc2(Msg1, Msg2, Opts)-> io:format(\"Inc: ~p~n\", [Msg1]), Num = maps:get(>, Msg1), {ok, #{ > => Num + 1, > => maps:get(>, Msg1) }}. double2(Msg1, Msg2, Opts)-> Num = maps:get(>, Msg1), {ok, #{ > => Num * 2, > => maps:get(>, Msg1) }}. square2(Msg1, Msg2, Opts)-> Num = maps:get(>, Msg1), {ok, #{ > => Num * Num, > => maps:get(>, Msg1) }}. Add the stack@1.0 device to the HyperBEAM class in our test file.

The device has a dev_codec_json:to/1 method to convert an Erlang object to JSON. The internal device names are defined with preloaded_devices in hb_opts.erl. #{> => >, > => dev_codec_json} And you can internally execute all exposed methods. File/HyperBEAM/src/dev_codec_json.erlCopy-module(dev_codec_json). -export([to/1, from/1, commit/3, verify/3, committed/1, content_type/1]). -export([deserialize/3, serialize/3]). When you define a new method, don't forget to export it from mydev@1.0. From this point on, we'll always assume you're correctly exporting new methods. File/HyperBEAM/src/dev_mydev.erlCopy-export([ info_json/3 ]). info_json(Msg1, Msg2_, Opts) -> JSON = dev_codec_json:to(#{ > => > }), {ok, JSON}. Now stringified JSON is returned in body, and you can just JSON.parse(body) to get exactly what you return.

The msg1 fields are encoded by structured@1.0 and msg2 fields are decoded. FYI, msg1 is also different from the form we sent; msg1 is already decoded by httpsig@1.0 device. The msg1 object type is called TABM (Type Annotated Binary Message) and this is what HyperBEAM internally uses to circumvent the limitation that we can only pass flattened strings in the HTTP headers. Encoding / Decoding Steps So a client encodes a message with httpsig@1.0, then structured@1.0 into TABM, then signs it with http-message-signatures, then sends it to a HyperBEAM node. DATA = { path: \"/~wao@1.0/forward\", key: \"abc\" } TABM = encode_by_structured(DATA) HTTP_MSG = encode_by_httpsig(TABM) = Headers + Body SIGNED_HTTP_MSG = sign(HTTP_MSG) send(SIGNED_HTTP_MSG) The node receives it, verifies the signature, then decodes it first with structured@1.0 (msg1), then with httpsig@1.0 (msg2). Msg0 + Commitments = dev_codec_httpsig:verify(SIGNED_HTTP_MSG) Msg1(TABM) = dev_codec_httpsig:to(Msg0) + Device Msg2 = dev_codec_structured:to(Msg1) + Commitments + Path flat@1.0 is used to flatten and unflatten nested object paths in the httpsig@1.0 device since HTTP headers and body can only handle string values, not nested structures.
